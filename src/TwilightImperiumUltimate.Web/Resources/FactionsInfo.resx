    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="RohDhnaMechatronics_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;During the fall of the empire, as the Lazax were eradicated, their factories and trade secrets were left abandoned and forgotten by the great factions. It was in these ruins that the enterprising startup run by Roh'vhin Dhna found its start. As the Twilight Wars raged, the need for better and more ships and factories grew faster than anyone in the galaxy could fulfill it. Roh'Dhna Mechatronics rose to the challenge and made a name for itself on this new stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;As the corporation grew, Dhna needed a centralized space to manage their operations. He found this space in a small wild and unsettled planet named Prind near the galactic core. After brief negotiations, the planet was purchased, and construction began. What started as a plan for a large company city to house Roh'Dhna's central operations expanded to the urbanization of the entire planet. After Roh'vhin Dhna passed away, the planet continued on, with megacities each handling the operation of a different division of the company. An automaton calling itself Roh'vhin Dhna MkI appeared, taking control of the company. Dhna MkI organized the conversion of Prind's crust into fleet megafoundries, power facilities, and communications offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is divided between two pillars: Operations and Communications. The technomancers of Operations use their near-miraculous knowledge of engineering and chemistry to take fantastical Hylarian ship designs and bring them to reality. The ruthless automatons of Communications long ago phased out their living counterparts as their programming has made them much more effective and approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rond Bri'ay was discovered by the company as a child on a backwater planet, in a small colony which had only a squadron of fighters for protection. Bri'ay had developed a knack for making small adjustments to ships' armor plating to optimize their protection. By the time Bri'ay turned 20 he used his talent to retrofit space docks all over the galaxy to support their own fighter squadrons. While traveling the galaxy he experienced the motives of all the great factions and grew a distaste for them all. At the youthful age of 25, Bri'ay developed a new kind of dock, an enormous structure which could both produce legions of ships and defend itself in combat against even the mightiest of capital ships. For this accomplishment, Bri'ay received a promotion to Master of Operations, leading half the company.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bri’ay had begun a campaign within the company during his travels, convincing his fellow technomancers that Roh'dhna Mechatronics must invest itself not only in the great factions’ wars, but within every aspect of their societies. His cause was popular, but Chief Executive Roh'vhin Dhna MK3 and the Communications automata were set on executing within the traditional avenues of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dhna MK3 was mysteriously lost during a pirate raid on its trade vessel, and some have commented that its successor Mk4 appeared much more quickly than earlier iterations. The new automaton saw the company’s growth was stagnating, with production disorganized, and chose to secretly modify the corporate objective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To outside observers nothing changed: supply ships still flew to planets on all sides of wars, docks still built fleets, and sales droids still negotiated contracts. But a keen eye might notice peculiarities. Shipments of duranium declared missing, fleets in production rerouted for unscheduled inspections, and steady declines in quality. The galaxy descending into chaos once more, Roh'Dhna Mechatronics has started to refit their production centers as hulking warships, preparing to act on their new primary objective: Galactic Acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Not far past the Unicorn Nebula, the golden
Sardakk star shines its ancient, hot light on giant
oceanless Quinarra. The massive planet radiates a red
glow like a dusty ruby in the night, its massive polar
storms clearly visible from space. A great network of
orbital space stations and massive complements of fleet
units occupy the system in the fashion of the insectile
N’orr. Massive whale-like N’orr carriers spew fighters
like angry hornets from a disturbed nest. Convoys of
ice-mountain transports are always inbound from the
planet Tren’lak. Small spider-like robotic ships drill
into the sides of the ice, guiding the ice to the orbital
liquid-processing plants, after which the derived water
and salt is flown to Quinarra by bloated sungliders
that, like beetle balloons, slowly descend to the N’orr
cities below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;Quinarra itself is among the most inhospitable
of planets inhabited by a major civilization. Only
Letnev’s Arc Prime is recognized as more desolate than
Quinarra. The Letnev, however, live exclusively under
Arc Prime’s surface, whereas the N’orr civilization is well
established both on and below Quinarra’s continents.
Only Quinarra’s polar regions, where even the hardy
N’orr cannot survive the deadly storms for extended
periods of time, are largely uninhabited. Brutal electric,
hail, and dust storms, although not approaching the
ferocity of the polar storms, are frequent throughout
the planet and considered normal by the N’orr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors to Quinarra will be flown directly
to the immigration nexus in the capital H’cor. If
weather permits sufficient visibility, most visitors
will be impressed by the massive size and explosive
traffic of the city. The N’orr structures are typically
oval or rounded, created from a hardened reddish
material similar to the general topography of the
planet. Like most major N’orr cities, H’cor features
towering building constructs, sprawling low-story
buildings, and deep gorges that reveal city-nests
deep below the surface, delving into the red
earth. Busy roads and hover-lanes cross the
city in a thousand ways, often congested with
N’orr traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The N’orr will tell you
that they are ruled by “Sardakk
the Queen Mother,” but that
acknowledgment seems more
steeped in ritual than fact. None have
ever met the mythical “mother,” and no off-world
documentation exists suggesting there is any truth to
the notion. The accepted and visible head of the N’orr
state is the Envoy of the Queen, a male N’orr in direct
command of the cultural, economic, and military
matters of the race. The length of the Envoy’s tenure
and the process of his election seems to be decided by
a secret brotherhood, the “Veiled Brood,” in which lies
the real power of the N’orr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Envoy and the Veiled Brood oversee the rapid
expansion of the N’orr military forces and fleets. The
Tekklar Elite soldiers are the pride of their people. The
Tekklar train exclusively in the southern polar regions,
where the weak die and the strong become G’hom:
members of the prestigious Tekklar order, treated like
knights by the N’orr and feared across the galaxy. As
Quinarra slowly turns, as the stars again come into
their right constellations, the Veiled Brood knows that
the time to swarm is coming again. And this time, the
swarm will cover the stars.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    &lt;li&gt;The hit produced by &lt;i&gt;Valkyrie Particle Weave&lt;/i&gt; is added to any other hits produced in the immediately preceding &lt;b&gt;Roll Dice&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Valkyrie Particle Weave&lt;/i&gt; produces a hit before any hits may be cancelled. Cancelling the original hits will not cause the additional hit to be cancelled.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The N&amp;rsquo;orr player producing zero hits with their combat roll will not prevent &lt;i&gt;Valkyrie Particle Weave&lt;/i&gt; from producing an additional hit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the opponent produces a hit, &lt;i&gt;Valkyrie Particle Weave&lt;/i&gt; mandatorily produces a hit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Exotrireme &lt;sub&gt;(Unit)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When resolving the ability of an Exotrireme II, the N&amp;rsquo;orr player chooses which ships are destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The N&amp;rsquo;orr cannot choose their own ships as targets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Effects that cancel hits, such as the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability, cannot be used to prevent ships from being destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player retreats, the N&amp;rsquo;orr player will be unable to use the ability of an Exotrireme II to destroy an opponent&amp;rsquo;s ship.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the N&amp;rsquo;orr player is in a combat with the Yin player, then the two players will alternate when resolving end of combat round abilities, starting with the attacker.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Planets in the home system of an eliminated player will not contribute to unlocking G&amp;rsquo;hom Sek&amp;rsquo;kus.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This ability allows the N&amp;rsquo;orr player to commit ground forces to a planet even if they have no ships in the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Parley&lt;/i&gt; action card will place the committed ground forces in the space area of the active system. If the N&amp;rsquo;orr player does not have enough capacity in the space area for the extra ground forces, including zero capacity, they will have to remove fighters and ground forces to meet capacity limits.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The N&amp;rsquo;orr player may commit up to one ground force from each eligible planet during each &lt;b&gt;Commit Ground Forces&lt;/b&gt; step, regardless of the number of planets they are committing ground forces to.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The N&amp;rsquo;orr player may only commit ground forces as the active player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Only the active player may use the &lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt; ability of their units during an invasion. As such, any ships in the active system will be unable to use their &lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt; ability unless they belong to the N&amp;rsquo;orr player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This prevents the L1Z1X player from using their &lt;sc&gt;Harrow&lt;/sc&gt; faction ability, unless they have the N&amp;rsquo;orr &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note and they are the active player.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Another player may still produce hits against the N&amp;rsquo;orr player&amp;rsquo;s ground forces committed using G&amp;rsquo;hom Sek&amp;rsquo;kus during the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Defense&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The N&amp;rsquo;orr player must legally be able to move into the destination system in order to commit ground forces with G&amp;rsquo;hom Sek&amp;rsquo;kus&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If another player plays the N&amp;rsquo;orr player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Ceasefire&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, they cannot commit any ground forces to planets in the active system during this action, other than ground forces already in the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The N&amp;rsquo;orr player cannot commit ground forces to Mirage if it is in an asteroid field, unless the N&amp;rsquo;orr player owns the &lt;i&gt;Antimass Deflectors&lt;/i&gt; technology.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The N&amp;rsquo;orr player cannot commit ground forces to Mirage if it is in a supernova. Another player may do so if they own the &lt;i&gt;Magmus Reactor&lt;/i&gt; Muaat faction technology and the N&amp;rsquo;orr player&amp;rsquo;s Alliance promissory note.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the N&amp;rsquo;orr player commits any ground forces from a gravity rift system, those ground forces must roll for removal.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The N&amp;rsquo;orr player cannot commit ground forces through a wormhole if the &lt;i&gt;Enforced Travel Ban&lt;/i&gt; law is in play.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The N&amp;rsquo;orr player may use this ability to commit ground forces to any planet in the active system, regardless of who, if anyone, controls it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the N&amp;rsquo;orr player purges the &lt;i&gt;Dominus Orb&lt;/i&gt; relic during the &lt;b&gt;Movement&lt;/b&gt; step of a tactical action, they may use G&amp;rsquo;hom Sek&amp;rsquo;kus to commit ground forces from systems that contain their command tokens during that tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Commit Ground Forces&lt;/b&gt; step is entirely resolved before the &lt;b&gt;Establish Control&lt;/b&gt; step (with other steps between). When the N&amp;rsquo;orr player gains control of their fifth non&amp;ndash;home system planet, an unlocks G&amp;rsquo;hom Sek&amp;rsquo;kus, they cannot then use G&amp;rsquo;hom Sek&amp;rsquo;kus to commit additional ground forces during that tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ground forces cannot be committed to a planet if it has the &lt;i&gt;Demilitarized Zone&lt;/i&gt; exploration card attached.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sh&amp;rsquo;val, Harbinger &amp;mdash; Tekklar Conditioning &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Parley&lt;/i&gt; action card will place the committed ground forces in the space area of the active system. As the N&amp;rsquo;orr player will not have enough capacity in the space area for their ground forces, they will have to remove all ground forces from that planet, that are now in the space area of that system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Space Combat&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Bombardment&lt;/b&gt; steps are skipped.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Another player may still produce hits against the N&amp;rsquo;orr player&amp;rsquo;s ground forces committed using &lt;i&gt;Tekklar Conditioning&lt;/i&gt; during the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Defense&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any abilities that trigger &amp;ldquo;after a player moves ships&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; or similar cannot be used following &lt;i&gt;Tekklar Conditioning&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;On first approach to Nestphar, a first-time visitor may
be surprised by the soupy haze that bleeds from the planet’s
atmosphere like a dusty cloud. This cloud consists of
quadrillions of tiny living spores emitted by Nestphar’s many
Flaah, city-sized floating forests in its stratosphere. 
The shortlived (and therefore continually resupplied) orbital presence
of the Flaah spores allows the Arborec denizens in Nestphar’s
space-stations and shipyards to remain in continuous
symbiotic contact with their planet. The Arborec term for this
vital connection, shared among all living things on Nestphar, is
best translated as “the Symphony.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When traveling beyond the reach of Nestphar’s Flaah spores,
and therefore outside connection to the prime Symphony, the
Arborec employ the massive Letani. Physically, the Letani are
the largest sentient beings yet discovered in the galaxy (each
slightly larger than a Sol Elephantus), their bodies resembling
a kraken-shaped mushroom crossed with a monstrous
carnivorous flower. The Letani are each uniquely capable of
embodying a powerful instance of the Symphony (and are
therefore closest to an “individual” within Arborec society)
which may act as a harmonic nexus for Arborec organisms
in near proximity. All ships in the Arborec fleet are based
around the presence of at least one (with some ships as many
as five) Letani orchestrating the unity of Arborec lifeforms
crewing the vessel. Once a Letani returns to the embrace of
Nestphar’s prime Symphony, its experiences are reconnected
and absorbed into the Arborec, as a data-capsule would be
reconnected to its mainframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While surely intelligent and demonstrably capable
of crafting impressive technologies, structures, and a
sophisticated fleet of interstellar craft, the Arborec’s method
of communication remains a source of great controversy.
Being a race of vegetative and fungal matter, handling its own
data transmission and emotive projection through the prime
Symphony, the Arborec have never developed any form of
visual or auditory communication (concepts which, to this
day, remain foreign to them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arborec scientists found the solution to this dilemma in the
Sol merchant vessel Dies Opulen. The crew of the Dies Opulen
had tragically become infected by Yborin Plague on Maaluk
and had later died in deep space. When the derelict ship was
found by an Arborec scout, it was determined the cool bodies
of the human crew were in perfect condition for an ambitious
experiment. The bodies were sent to the great laboratories in
Kushin, near the Arborec capital Phara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, fungal Arzuga cells were attached to the brainstems
of the dead humans. It was hoped, when grown under proper
conditions, the complex acidic properties of Arzuga would
successfully merge the cells with the innate brain-tissue of the
deceased subjects, slowly re-stimulating the neural pathways
back to life. Then, by injecting photo-voltaic stims into the
soft tissues of the dead body, the neurally active Arzuga
would spur the soft tissue cells to heal and regrow, effectively
reanimating the dead body. Symbiotically attached to the
host body, the Arzuga
fungi evolved into a new
being, one which the Arborec
call the Dirzuga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dirzuga were the missing
link between the Symphony and the
manifestation of physical communication that the Arborec
lacked. Over the following few decades, the Arborec eagerly
acquired additional subjects (human bodies seem to work best
and are the most frequently used, but Letnev, Winnu, and Xxcha
bodies are also commonly used as Dirzuga hosts), establishing a
sizable diplomatic and trading corps that have become the basis
for the Arborec’s interaction with the rest of the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arborec insist the host bodies of the Dirzuga are
devoid of the expired individuals’ consciousness. With a
cultural relationship to death rooted in the natural cycle
of decomposition and regrowth, the Arborec have little
understanding or sympathy for those who vigorously protest
against the bodies of their citizens being reused (some use the
term “enslaved”) in such a manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, despite the objections of the dissident races, the
Arborec were admitted as a member of the galactic council. The
potential wealth of foodstuffs, medicines, and other treasures
of Nestphar proved effective in overcoming any objections.
While the Arborec insist that the past knowledge and
experiences of Dirzuga bodies do not persist beyond this
reanimation, there are some who suspect the Arborec do not
tell the entire truth. Such theorists can provide many examples
in which the Arborec seem to have come upon information,
or intimate understanding of other cultures, that seem
inexplicable otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="TheArborec_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;h1&gt;Mitosis&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Arborec player produces one or more units with a space dock, and produces any infantry with their Letani Warriors, the produced infantry may be placed on the same planet as the space dock, regardless of if that planet contains any Letani Warriors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Arborec player may produce Letani Behemoth with their space docks.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Placing the infantry during the status phase is mandatory (unless the Arborec player controls no planets).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stymie &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stymie&lt;/i&gt; has no effect while it is in a player&amp;rsquo;s hand.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stymie&lt;/i&gt; is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Arborec player this turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Activating a system containing only the Arborec player&amp;rsquo;s structures will still cause &lt;i&gt;Stymie&lt;/i&gt; to be returned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Arborec player&amp;rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/i&gt; strategy card), this will not cause &lt;i&gt;Stymie&lt;/i&gt; to be returned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Stymie &amp;Omega; &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player has no command tokens in their reinforcements, that player places one command token of their choice from their command sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stymie&lt;/i&gt; cannot place a command token in the home system of an eliminated player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bioplasmosis &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any number of infantry may move, but all movement is done simultaneously, and no infantry may move beyond an adjacent system. For example, consider a series of systems A&amp;ndash;B&amp;ndash;C. Only systems connected by a &amp;ldquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;rdquo; are adjacent. In this case:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;An infantry cannot move from A to B, then B to C.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;An infantry may move from A to B, while another infantry moves from B to C.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;An infantry may move from A to B, while another infantry moves from C to B.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;An infantry may move from B to A, while another infantry moves from B to C.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;An infantry may move from A to B, while another infantry moves from B to A. This will have no meaningful effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bioplasmosis&lt;/i&gt; cannot move Letani Behemoth.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Letani Warrior &lt;sub&gt;(Unit)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Arborec player cannot use the secondary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Warfare&lt;/i&gt; strategy card to use the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability of a Letani Warrior.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When multiple units use their &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability, the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; value is pooled. As such, if the Arborec player has two Letani Warrior I in a system, they may produce two infantry for one resource, rather than two.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If Letani Warriors are on different planets, any produced ground forces may be split between those planets, regardless of the production value of the Letani Warriors on that planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Duha Menaimon&lt;/i&gt; must be in the system when it is activated for its effect to trigger. It will not trigger if it is moved into the active system later in the turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Letani Ospha &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Sarween Tools&lt;/i&gt; technology and similar effects will not allow a more expensive ship to be placed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the player wishes to place a ship, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a ship of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead. This ship will be placed undamaged.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A fighter may be placed with Letani Ospha.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dirzuga Rophal &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The produced unit must be paid for.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The unit is produced before ships move. A ship may be produced if no other player currently has ships in that system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No unit is using its &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability. The &lt;i&gt;Sarween Tools&lt;/i&gt; technology and similar effects will not apply.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a ground force is produced, it may be placed on any planet the Arborec player controls in that system, regardless of what units, if any, the Arborec player has on that planet. The produced ground force may also be placed in the space area of that system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Arborec player wishes to place a unit, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead. This unit will be placed undamaged.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;No unit is using its &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability. The &lt;i&gt;Sarween Tools&lt;/i&gt; technology and similar effects will not apply.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a ground force is produced in a system, it may be placed on any planet the Arborec player controls in that system, regardless of what units, if any, the Arborec player has on that planet. The produced ground force may also be placed in the space area of that system.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The Arborec player may produce Letani Behemoth with their space docks.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="TheArgentFlight_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Few alive today have dealings with the Shikrai. This collection of related avian subspecies lives scattered across a stretch of the galactic rim. Their clutch of worlds are dry, windswept, and poor, lacking in valuable resources or useful minerals. Their small and technologically backward populations tend to stay out of galactic affairs. Most rightfully dismiss the Shikrai as just one more group of sentients in a galaxy full of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is more to the Shikrai than the rest of the galaxy, or even themselves, realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long ago, Shikrai territory had the misfortune of being the disputed vassalage of two powerful Mahact. These genesorcerers fought a vicious internecine war for the avians’ planets, with the Shikrai forced to fight as proxies on both sides. Shikrai partisans fought back as best they could, but they had no hope of defeating the armies of two gene-sorcerers. There was no doubt the Shikrai would be consumed by the fight to claim them…until a Lazax battlegroup arrived. A Lazax warlord named Harkor Ilban Tal liberated the Shikrai and personally slew both gene-sorcerers in single combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pay their debt, the remaining Shikrai immediately allied with Tal. Eventually, when the Mahact were exiled beyond the Acheron Gate, the Shikrai made a pledge to their allies. They would contribute a tithe of their best warriors and scholars to found an organization that would watch Acheron and ensure the Mahact would never return. They would call it the Argent Flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, the Shikrai turned to their ancestral homeworlds of Valk, Avar, and Ylir, which they had abandoned long ago when they set out to colonize the stars. The Lazax erased all mention of the worlds from their newly constructed Hall of Cartography, and the newly founded Argent Flight retreated to their sanctuary to wait…and prepare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valk, Avar, and Ylir are curiosities even in a galaxy full of wonders. The three worlds are barely larger than moons, and share a narrow orbit between the neutron star Phorus and the gas giant Hacid. The unique environment created the Atharal Gas Torus—a ring of breathable air in orbit around Phorus. The three worlds orbit in the center of the ring, and the Shikrai say their winged ancestors used to fly from world to world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the millennia since their return, the Argent Flight has worked hard to colonize the three worlds and the smaller chunks of rock that drift between them. Numerous flocks of Shikrai live throughout the torus. Each flock focuses on a different trade or calling, and any member of the Argent Flight can join or leave a flock as they choose. Their actions are coordinated by the Murmeration, a council of representatives from each flock who direct the Argent Flight from their spindle tower sanctuary on Avar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Murmeration continues to quietly recruit promising members from the various Shikrai worlds, though the population of the Atharal Torus is now large enough to be selfsustaining. It has also developed beyond simply a martial order into a fully functional society. Large-bellied cloud-scoops dive into the atmosphere of Hacid to gather rare gases that can be refined into industrial compounds, while the cometminers of the outer system keep the Atharal Torus well-supplied in fresh water. The Argent Flight has even genecrafted the massive, zero-gravity trees that live free-floating in the Torus so that they grow edible fruits, and has built mechanical grav-wings so that its members can soar from planet to planet once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Argent Flight still remembers its sworn oaths. Millennia of service have seen its duty evolve into something akin to a religion, and the Shikrai see themselves as sacred guardians appointed by the galaxy’s rightful rulers. The various flocks never revealed themselves to the wider galaxy during the Twilight Wars. Instead they fought their own battles in the shadows against the Mahact’s sleeper agents and greedy explorers who ventured too deeply into Shaleri Space. And they succeeded in their task until a new race, the Creuss, sent an expedition past the Tolari Pulsar too large to defeat in combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the Mahact’s awakening, the Argent Flight has begun to gather its forces. The Murmeration is in accord; the time for secrecy is past. Already, agents move amongst the Shikrai worlds, calling worthy fighters to take the vows of the Flight. In the open-air ship docks of the Atharal Torus, master shipwrights have laid down the keels of sleek, gull-winged destroyers. The Argent Flight knows, now that its ancient nemesis has returned, that it has no choice—it must lead the rest of the galaxy on a holy crusade to finish what the Lazax started so long ago.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    &lt;li&gt;Additional votes must be cast for the same outcome as the other votes the Argent player cast.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Argent player abstains or otherwise casts zero votes, they cannot cast additional votes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Argent player always votes first, even if they are the speaker.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Other players vote in their regular order after the Argent player votes; clockwise starting with the player to the left of the speaker (skipping over the Argent player as necessary).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Raid Formation&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/b&gt; step happens during each space combat, even if no fighters are present in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;sc&gt;Raid Formation&lt;/sc&gt; occurs when hits are produced, not after hits are assigned. As such, cancelling any hits will not prevent an opponent&amp;rsquo;s ships from becoming damaged.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If any of the anti&amp;ndash;fighter barrage dice are rerolled, the number of ships that become damaged will depend only on the rerolled values.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Argent player may choose a damaged ship. This will have no effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The chosen ship becomes damaged, it does not use its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability. As such, effects that trigger when a ship uses its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability, such as the &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Reflective Shielding&lt;/i&gt; action cards, cannot be played.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The chosen ship may be repaired by the &lt;i&gt;Duranium Armor&lt;/i&gt; technology later in the same round of combat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Argent player plays the &lt;i&gt;Waylay&lt;/i&gt; action card, hits in excess of their opponent&amp;rsquo;s fighters will first cause chosen ships to become damaged, then those same hits must still be assigned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, say the opponent has three fighters and three dreadnoughts, undamaged. The Argent player plays &lt;i&gt;Waylay&lt;/i&gt;, and rolls five hits. This allows them to cause two of the dreadnoughts to become damaged. The opponent then has to assign all five hits. The final dreadnought may use its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability to cancel one of those hits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Argent player is in combat with the Nekro player, and the Nekro player has their mechs participating in the space combat via the effects of &lt;i&gt;The Alastor&lt;/i&gt;, those mechs may become damaged by the effect of &lt;sc&gt;Raid Formation&lt;/sc&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The planet with &amp;ldquo;&lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; 1&amp;rdquo; is considered to be on itself for the purposes of producing ground forces.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player with the &lt;i&gt;Light/Wave Deflector&lt;/i&gt; technology cannot move their ships through systems containing the Argent player's structures, if the Argent player owns &lt;i&gt;Aerie Hololattice&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Strike Wing Alpha &lt;sub&gt;(Unit)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a Strike Wing Alpha II rolls a 9 or 10 for their &lt;sc&gt;anti&amp;ndash;fighter barrage&lt;/sc&gt; ability, infantry are destroyed at the end of the &lt;b&gt;Roll Dice&lt;/b&gt; step. This occurs before any ship may use its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability at the start of the &lt;b&gt;Assign Hits&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Effects that cancel hits, such as the &lt;i&gt;Shields Holding&lt;/i&gt; action card, cannot prevent the infantry from being destroyed. If an effect rerolls any anti&amp;ndash;fighter barrage dice, the new result will determine how many infantry are destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the last of a player&amp;rsquo;s ground forces are destroyed by the ability of a Strike Wing Alpha II, and that player meets the other conditions for elimination, that player is immediately eliminated. All of their units are removed from the board, and the Argent player wins the combat.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A future rule change will allow a player&amp;rsquo;s ships to transport units from systems that contain that player&amp;rsquo;s command token when those ships move outside of a tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ships move directly to their destination system. They may only transport units from their origin system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ships moving out of a gravity rift must roll for removal.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ships cannot move into a nebula or supernova, even if it contains one of the Argent player&amp;rsquo;s command tokens.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;In the Cradle of Ilyxum system, the people of the Ilyxum hold a deep reverence for their prophetic artificial intelligence known as The Oracle. The two largest planets in the Cradle, Chiron and Demis, have been bent to the Augurs’ purpose. Demis, the first planet in the system, is a barren world with a toxic atmosphere, but the Augurs have built vast underground cities to shield themselves from the harsh conditions on that planet's surface and to provide silent, cavernous halls in which to contemplate the Oracle's wisdom. Chiron, the second planet, is a lush and fertile world with a diverse ecosystem. The Augurs have built great observatories on Demis to study the stars and to seek the insight and guidance from their Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Augurs of Ilyxum are governed by a hierarchical system, with the Oracle at the pinnacle of power. The Oracle speaks only to a select group of individuals, known as the Chosen, who are responsible for interpreting the Oracle's messages and guiding the course of Augur society. The Chosen are selected at a young age and undergo years of rigorous training to prepare them for their role. The Augurs of Ilyxum believe that the Oracle is the source of all wisdom and knowledge, and they follow its guidance without question. The AI itself routinely speaks in half-thoughts, indicating calculated possibilities and probabilities through a form of poetic code. Who was responsible for developing this technological mix of science and artistry is unknown, but the Augurs know their Oracle is deeply intertwined with the fabric of the universe and its proclamations are glimpses into an unrelenting future. Because of this firm belief, few of the Ilyxum question the path set before them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Augurs of Ilyxum have a unique way of life that is heavily influenced by their reverence for the Oracle. The Augurs believe that everything in the universe is connected and that the future is knowable through interpreting the Oracle's prophecies. They find purpose in helping guide the course of the universe towards its predestined fate. To that end, the Oracle does not have a known mechanism for input: the Augurs explain to confused outsiders that there is no reason to provide the Oracle with any information, since it is merely expressing the existing, fixed path of the universe. The very concept of 'giving' it information is absurd, perhaps even blasphemous; all they may do is ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, the Augurs of Ilyxum focused mostly on deep introspection and contemplative observation. They spent much of their time in quiet meditation and study. As a highly intellectual and technologically advanced people, they developed a sophisticated network of observatories and sensors to monitor the movements of the stars and the tides of the universe. In times of peace, they used this information to guide their decisions, and to seek insight into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is not a time of peace. Recent power struggles in the galaxy have stirred the Augurs into activity. Various powerful players on the galactic stage now warn of cryptic fates, have begun to explore new fields of dangerous research, and engage in unexplained efforts to recover ancient relics. It is time for the Augurs to bring their vision of the future to the galaxy. They have always believed the universe moves inexorably toward a predetermined end, and it is time to remind the galaxy who best sees the path ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  </data>
  <data name="TheBaronyOfLetnev_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;In the very blackness of space lies cold, hard Arc
Prime. Its system has no central star, and Arc Prime’s
lack of defined orbit has been a mystery to scientists for
millennia. It is a common jest that Arc Prime is simply
afloat in space, and that only the Letnev disdain for
the rest of the galaxy protects it from a fatal collision.
The Letnev’s principal vassal, Wren Terra, shines like a
mighty star in the ebon distance, while thorny military
ships surround the dark planet like fireflies attracted to
a black hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign visitors to Arc Prime will, under heavy fighter
escort, be directed to the Dunlain Crater. The crater holds
the sprawling city of Feruc, Arc Prime’s only city located
on the planetary surface. Feruc is a pressurized mesh of
icy black metal housing, belching industries, warehouses,
and military installations. The thin atmosphere of Arc
Prime prohibits normal surface life outside the cold
pressurized facilities of Feruc. Since the Barony has no
use for the meager atmosphere of Arc Prime, it freely
emits unfiltered pollutants from the underground Letnev
cities and factories to the surface. A journey to Feruc is
likely to leave a thick layer of frozen black residue on any
vessel. It is a common merchant endearment to call a ship
returning from Arc Prime a “Chimney Sweeper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the surface of Arc Prime, heated by its
planetary core, the Baron presides over the proud and
fierce Letnev people. Few non-natives have ever visited
the capital Goz, fabled “city of a billion,” or the other six
major underground urban centers of Arc Prime. A gray
organic plant material, called Ao by the Letnev, is found
everywhere in Arc Prime’s underground. It is Ao that
supplies the oxygen to the enormous cavern-networks,
and the plant is held in almost religious awe and respect
by the Letnev people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although tens of thousands of moist fungus caves are
farmed by an army of intelligent machines, the Letnev’s
great weakness has always been its shortage of food,
liquid, medicines, and essential vitamins. The
ancient Lazax kept the aggressive race in check
by maintaining strict control of the Letnev food
supplies and trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the time of the Lazax Empire,
the Letnev led two unsuccessful rebellions
against the Imperium. Their history of dissension
justified a constant imperial oversight of Arc
Prime and its people. The
Letnev blockade of the Quann
wormhole at the end of the Age of
Dusk was started in protest over the
Lazax sanctions and supervision. It was
the Quann conflict that ignited the Twilight Wars and
the final downfall of the empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Wren Terra was annexed by the Letnev during
the latter years of the Age of Dusk, their colonies here have
been primarily occupied with growing and supplying food
for the population of Arc Prime. Foreign trade with the
Letnev consists mainly of foodstuffs, for which merchants
receive metals, weapons, and the sharp Saimoc—strong
crystals used in mining operations across the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baron keeps order by maintaining a strict
bureaucracy, discipline, and an elitist military culture
that brings the strongest and the smartest directly under
his control. The pale Letnev despise light, and will often
wear protective headgear when visiting other worlds
with bright sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legendary Letnev troops are only surpassed
in brute strength by the Tekklar N’orr elite soldiers of
distant Quinarra. With the new awakening of ambitions
among the great races, the resurgence of interstellar
commerce, and the recent momentum of the Galactic
Council, the Baron has secretly been preparing to lead
his people to final dominance. Baron Daz Emmiciel
Werqan III has only one ambition: to become emperor
at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Letnev player has zero command tokens in their fleet pool, they may still have ships on the game board. While this is the case, effects that remove command tokens from a player&amp;rsquo;s fleet pool cannot affect the Letnev player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;War Funding &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may play &lt;i&gt;War Funding&lt;/i&gt; when the Letnev player has zero or one trade goods. The Letnev player will lose the single trade good, if applicable, and the other effects will resolve as normal.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may receive &lt;i&gt;War Funding&lt;/i&gt; in a transaction during a combat. If received at the start of a round, that player may play it immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A transaction must involve the active player. As such, the defender will be unable to receive &lt;i&gt;War Funding&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive &lt;i&gt;War Funding&lt;/i&gt; more than once per turn.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the active player received &lt;i&gt;War Funding&lt;/i&gt; on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Letnev player to regain it. However, &lt;i&gt;War Funding&lt;/i&gt; cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play &lt;i&gt;War Funding&lt;/i&gt; again until the next round of combat.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the attacker receives &lt;i&gt;War Funding&lt;/i&gt; after the defender has played it, the attacker cannot play it during the same round of combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;A transaction must involve the active player. As such, the defender will be unable to receive &lt;i&gt;War Funding &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive &lt;i&gt;War Funding &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; more than once per turn.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the active player received &lt;i&gt;War Funding &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Letnev player to regain it. However, &lt;i&gt;War Funding &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play &lt;i&gt;War Funding&lt;/i&gt; again until the next round of combat.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the attacker receives &lt;i&gt;War Funding &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; after the defender has played it, the attacker cannot play it during the same round of combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may only reroll combat rolls with &lt;i&gt;War Funding &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt;. They cannot reroll anti&amp;ndash;fighter barrage rolls and similar.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;L4 Disruptors &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may still use the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability of their units against the Letnev player&amp;rsquo;s ships during the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; step in this system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Non&amp;ndash;Euclidean Shielding &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Non&amp;ndash;Euclidean Shielding&lt;/i&gt; may be applied when a Dunlain Reaper uses its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Non&amp;ndash;Euclidean Shielding&lt;/i&gt; applies whenever hits are produced. This includes hits produced by &lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt; and &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Letnev player must cancel two hits whenever one of their units uses its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability; they cannot cancel just one.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Say the Letnev player has exactly one hit produced against them remaining, and one of their units uses its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability to cancel it. If additional hits are produced against the Letnev player's units, such as with the &lt;i&gt;Reflective Shielding&lt;/i&gt; action card, the Letnev player cannot retroactively use the previous use of &lt;sc&gt;Sustain damage&lt;/sc&gt; to allow &lt;i&gt;Non&amp;ndash;Euclidean Shielding&lt;/i&gt; to cancel a second hit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Arc Secundus &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Arc Secundus&lt;/i&gt; is not repaired at the end of combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Arc Secundus&lt;/i&gt; only uses its repair ability during combats it is participating in.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Arc Secundus&lt;/i&gt; has no effect on the &lt;i&gt;Magen Defense Grid &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Viscount Unlenn &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This ability only applies to combat rolls. It does not apply to dice rolls for a unit&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The extra dice is mandatory for the chosen unit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Rear Admiral Farran &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Letnev player has more ships in a system than allowed for by their fleet pool plus &lt;sc&gt;Armada&lt;/sc&gt;, they must first remove ships to meet this limit before they can unlock Rear Admiral Farran.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This effect may be applied when a Dunlain Reaper uses its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Ul player has the Letnev player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, then this effect may be applied when a Hel&amp;ndash;Titan PDS uses its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A unit that becomes damaged without using its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability will not trigger this effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If multiple units use their &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability within a single step, the trade goods are gained one at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Darktalon Treilla &amp;mdash; Dark Matter Affinity &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The game round ends after the agenda phase (or the status phase if the custodians token is yet to be removed from Mecatol Rex).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;At the end of the game round the Letnev player might need to remove ships from the board to satisfy fleet pool limits.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dunlain Reaper &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A &lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt; ability may be resolved only once per timing window. As such, the Letnev player may only place one Dunlain Reaper this way per ground combat round.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Further Dunlain Reapers may be placed in later rounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A &lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt; ability may only be resolved for units in a player&amp;rsquo;s reinforcements. If all four Dunlain Reapers are already on the board, no Dunlain Reaper may be deployed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a Dunlain Reaper is destroyed during combat, then another may be deployed in a later round of the same combat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEO Kenn Tuce has recently been inclined to encourage internally managed exploration, rather than relying entirely on third parties. This has the additional benefit of being able to obscure some discoveries entirely behind the corporate veil. Certain particularly rare relics might therefore never see the light of day, being secreted for internal purposes, or war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The siren call of the galactic council has stirred something in the Bentor Conglomerate—being able to dominate legislative strategy to the benefit of the corporations is an irresistible shortcut to financial success, and Bentor lobbyists have been strongly encouraging Conglomerate friendly laws.&lt;/p&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Survivors of encounters with the Kjalengard Berserkers sometimes call them the Li-Zho of War. Although the Kjalengard are an entirely unrelated species and bear only superficial morphological resemblance to the Li-Zho, their military prowess is unique among the galaxy’s aggressive powers: to the Kjalengard, victory is never an end in itself. Subterfuge or treachery in combat is as mortifying to the Kjalengard as physically harming a Li-Zho would be to a Li-Zho plotmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kjalengard government is made up of united clans, each led by a leader known as the chief skald. The chief skalds are chosen through a series of trials and challenges and only the strongest, most skilled and honorable of their people become chief skalds. An opponent defeated despite a dedicated and relentless display of martial prowess may yet become a lifelong friend or compatriot. To the Kjalengard, glory does not rest with the victory itself; this is because the universe is filled with unpredictable elements that not even the most skilled combatant can anticipate. It is truly the grace with which victory is achieved, or inevitable loss is accepted, that marks a song-worthy warrior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Kjalengard, a victory without honor, without glory, is as hollow as nutrition without flavor. The Kjalangard treat war like a five-course meal, and strategy or individual maneuvers are as important as the outcome. Entire squads of underperforming pilots have been known to be pulled from combat in the middle of a battle, lest they shame the remaining warriors and lessen the value of the ultimate victory. This focus on glory sees even fighter pilots and infantry fight not only for their own personal valor, but for the chance to be a part of the great war-stories that only a decisive and strategically beautiful battle can produce. The Kjalengard are masters of applied warfare technology, and it is not uncommon for opposing fleets to be carved apart by unexpected strike forces of carrier-supported fighters and invasion troops. Their moniker of ‘Berserker’ belies the care and thought that goes into Kjalengard warmaking. Tactical deployments of ships and infantry are a hallmark of their victory dance, and Kjalengard command often broadcasts the site of impending battles to their enemies as a form of competitive integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These broadcasts further function as both an intimidation tactic and a propaganda channel through which their battle prowess can be broadly witnessed by both present and future opponents. Kjalengard fleets will often disarm enemy ships with strategic fire, leaving them to spin helplessly and harmless as witnesses to glorious Kjalengard victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cultural habit has been exploited by less ethically bound opponents, as a Kjalengard military force does not expect or even acknowledge that their opponents would execute dishonorable tactics simply to win a hollow victory. Any enemy striking from the shadows in this way accepts a significant risk, however: if the treacherous attack does not win decisive victory, the Kjalengard Berserkers reveal why they are named so: an unworthy, treacherous opponent has tainted the battlefield, and tarnished any glory to be won. No songs will be sung in remembrance of their disgrace, and they are offered no quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The throne-world of Mecatol Rex calls to the Berserkers, a legendary battlefield tarnished by the treachery of a cowardly war. What better place could exist for their people to live and die a life worth telling stories about?&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the Twilight Wars, Jord leadership abandoned the Celdauri system and left its citizens to fend for themselves. Instead of collapsing into savagery, the planets in and near the Celdauri system banded together through trade and aid in order to survive. Eventually—through the guidance of the Merchant Families—stability came, and a loose trade alliance was born from the traditions of mutual aid. Consisting of twelve member planets and two core planets, the Trader Alliance was extensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
But all was not well. Piracy being an ever-present issue, the great Merchant Families were forced into further coordination and ingenuity in order to stave off the marauders, and encounters with alien empires forced the Merchant Families to develop a robust and effective navy. Thus when after millennia the reinvigorated forces of Sol arrived upon the doorstep of the Celdauri system, expecting an isolated society ready and willing to rejoin the Federation, they found instead a bustling society of trade, diplomacy, and initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federation’s arrival was a shock to the Merchant leaders. Having grown complacent on pirating being the greatest external threat for millennia, and lacking an advanced standing navy, the Merchant Families’ fleets of mercenaries were unable to resist the heel of the Federation. The trade worlds, one by one, came under the heel of Sol as their fleets advanced through the sector. It soon became clear that, because of the great wealth of the Trade Alliance, exorbitant taxes would be levied upon its worlds. A Procurator would be dispatched from Sol to oversee the former Trader Alliance, and the children of Trader Families would be conscripted into the endless wars of the Federation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;The Merchant Families would not remain compliant forever. Quietly, all in the name of trade, the Merchant Families, funded by a silent Trader Alliance, cells of anti-piracy defenses on the planets of the Merchant outpost filled with advanced sensor upgrades and AI systems. Merchant ships everywhere were upgraded and were trained to seize key assets and fight ferociously across officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly ten years after the Federation seized control of the Aklyon system, the Merchant Families struck. The Sol fleet occupying Celdauri space was split, half escorting a convoy under fabricated reports of increased piracy, while the other half was occupied by a ceremony to honor the Families’ new ambassador. The ambassador’s shuttle’s only occupant was a high-yield explosive. The Federation was entirely unprepared as the fully-refitted merchant navy opened fire in a vicious, effective, and decisive assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly-organized Celdauri Trade Confederation, now independent, is governed by a coalition of some dozen or so of the most powerful Celdauri trade groups and industry leaders. The guildmasters and merchant-lords control major aspects of Celdauri political and industrial spheres, and elect a High Councilor to lead them. Titus Flavius is the first and current holder of this office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flavius’ remarks on the first Union Day celebration embodied the spirit of resistance that lay in the hearts of all true Celdauri citizens. Though the future may be uncertain, the Celdauri Trade Confederation will face it resolutely, and independently.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Near the edge of the galaxy, unreachable by routine traffic but near the nearby gate, the Cheiran Reach awaits. The only worlds of note in this quiet corner of the galaxy are near-twin azure pearls—ocean planets that were until recently devoid of intelligent life. Arche and Gghurn Theta were first scouted and claimed by species from more populated regions of space. Early colonists were fond of the bounty of the sea, and their hunger had long outgrown the production of their own oceans’ biomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water worlds of the Reach, as-discovered, were home only to primitive sea life. The scant bits of land, barren and storm-swept, were transformed by these progenitor species into vast aquatic farms in which fish, aquatic plants, and all manner of other biological commodities were grown and harvested. As these farms developed, the colonists began to develop a semi-sentient breed of crustacean which, combined with certain bio-technology, could be relied upon to help maintain the sprawling aquaculture industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the great wars erupted, the colonists stationed here fled the system, relying on a skeleton crew and automated delivery lines to keep up supply lines. However, those who remained were not enough to maintain a stable population as the wars dragged on, and in time the Cheiran Reach was lost and forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the great wars subsided and the former colonizers rebuilt, records of the Reach were rediscovered and expeditions were launched to return. What they did not expect to find was what awaited them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The once docile crustacean caretakers had developed into a highly sophisticated and advanced sentient race, having been motivated by disaster, their advancement had been greatly accelerated by the technology left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return expeditions were hailed as soon as they entered the system. A transmission signal from what they called “Cheiran Hordes” was their first encounter with the nascent crustacean race. Though both parties were wary, they soon entered into tentative diplomatic discussions, and the progenitors were soon invited to hold pieces of their former holdings. From the stories, and indeed the history, of the Cheiran Hordes, how they had survived since full fledged war to abuse themselves as was ravaged by the galaxy beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after they had first achieved spaceflight, they came under attack from a mysterious machine intelligence. As a result, the Cheiran had to quickly adapt their society into one capable of war. The aging relics of industry and technology left behind millennia ago by the progenitors were unearthed and grafted together with new Cheiran bio-engineered technology. The Cheiran suffered great losses, and for a time they survived only as a small population hidden deep in the caves of Arche, but they eventually prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Arche is considered a quasi-holy planet by the Cheiran, and is closed to outsiders, despite being home to the majority of the Cheiran population. Here, from deep within the hidden capital city on Arche, an observant race tacitly controls Cheiran society. Though a chimera at its core since before the great violence, the government is effectively a totalitarian state controlled by the Cheiran First Polemarch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current Polemarch has been thrust into a position of leading the hordes into a new epoch. No longer isolated on the edge of known space, the Cheiran find themselves looking to their stars and wondering whether they will cautiously remain in their sheltered refuge, testing the currents, or if they will swim out upon the galaxy like a breaking wave.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Few historians dispute that the Saar were the first of the
known races to venture into space, but it remains unknown
whether it was need or curiosity that drove the otherwise
primitive people into such exploration. Their peaceful ways
and dispersed civilization never promulgated them to official
Lazax recognition. Some scholars have thus called them “the
forgotten race.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tale of the Saar is a tragic one. Historical records are
awash with accounts of deliberate planetary expulsions, even
massacres, of Saar settlements found on planets colonized by
the other races. The musical Saar often chant the “Lay of Lisis”
in memory of the largest known Saar colony prior to Ragh’s
Call. After the planet of Lisis was annexed by the Sardakk N’orr,
no word came from the great Saar settlement there again. They
simply disappeared. In their memory, most Saar females wear
a carefully carved silver pendant called the Y’ouf Lisis, or the
“Tear of Lisis.” During the Houw Shanan, the Saar Holy Day,
such pendants are given to young Saar women, while Saar cubs
throw beetles and insects into a raging fire and the elders howl
at the stars with a longing rage.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the Call began, the Saar were scattered across the
galaxy, existing at the mercy of other races. On dozens of
worlds, Saar could be found living in slums and sublevel cities,
working in the most noxious and despicable industries, and
making slim sustenance from the scraps of other civilizations.
Considered unclean and barely sentient by other races, Saar
life was cheap and subject to little justice. With hard work,
polluted environments, and no access to proper medical care,
the bitter lives of the Saar were often short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was in the hopeless middle period of the Dark Years that
a single Saar, Ragh Gavar, would forever change the destiny of
his people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ragh made his living as the captain of an old scrap metal
freighter that flew between Xxehan and Sol, a route that had
been in his family for centuries. Despite being a capable trader,
Ragh’s passion lay in poetry and the imagination of the pen, in
the creation of succinct writings of hope, scrawled on paper
scraps during long trade hauls. At his ports of call, other Saar
would often congregate before his loading doors so that they
might hear his latest verses and tales. Many of his listeners
began to call him the “Captain of Hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet one year, Ragh did not arrive at his destination.
His rusty navigation system had finally failed, and
Ragh’s ship was lost among the stars. Floating in
unknown space, as his ancestors had once done
so bravely before him, Ragh prayed that the One
Between the Stars would see him and his small
crew home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Call began a few years after Ragh Gavar’s
disappearance. Throughout the great expanses of
the galaxy, every Saar began to feel within himself an
unyielding longing for the stars, and especially for a certain
distant place beyond known space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early followers of the
Call found its origin in the
great asteroid field of Jorun, and
here found a small but blossoming
Saar colony on the two gigantic
asteroids of Ragh and Lisis II. As the Call
continued, Saar brethren from across the galaxy continued
to arrive at Jorun, together building the infrastructure of
civilization and hope for a lost race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years before, Ragh’s ship had crashed in the Jorun.
Miraculously, he and his crew had survived, and with great
wonder they soon discovered the mineral richness, frozen
water, atmospheric caverns, and strange fauna that lay hidden
within the endless ocean of rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Ragh was restless in his new home. It is told that the
Captain awoke one night from a dream and then bade his
crewmates farewell, disappearing into the great network of
caverns that lies within the asteroid named after him. Ragh
Gavar was never found or heard from again. But less than a
month after his disappearance, the Call began. Saar mystics
believe that the Captain of Hope has joined the One Between
the Stars, and that he at last won forgiveness for the Saar,
and has called them to relieve their suffering. They believe
that Ragh’s Call has brought them home, that the life-giving
rocks surrounding them are the remnants of the ancient Saar
planet of origin, and that even in death it is giving its people
a second life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For centuries the unified and passionate Saar people have
built a formidable home and civilization in the Jorun asteroid
field. The Saar have finally found home, and they have found
that they are strong.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    &lt;li&gt;A player may still use abilities such as action cards or &lt;sc&gt;Deep Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; that affect the Saar player&amp;rsquo;s units located in asteroid fields.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an asteroid field contains only non&amp;ndash;ship units belonging to the Saar player, it may still be activated by other players.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Floating Factory &lt;sub&gt;(Unit)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A floating Factory does not count towards the Saar player&amp;rsquo;s fleet pool.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a Floating Factory produces ground forces, they may be placed in the space area or on a planet they control in that system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Hits produced by space cannon rolls cannot be assigned to a Floating Factory.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Game effects that affect ship movement, such as the &lt;i&gt;Gravity Drive&lt;/i&gt; technology, the &lt;i&gt;Flank Speed&lt;/i&gt; action card, the &lt;i&gt;Light/Wave Deflector&lt;/i&gt; technology, the &lt;i&gt;Antimass Deflectors&lt;/i&gt; technology, etc, may affect Floating Factories.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A Floating Factory moving through or out of a gravity rift must roll for removal. It will receive the +1 to its movement.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Saar player announces a retreat during a space combat, but all their ships are destroyed that round, any Floating Factories in that system are destroyed without retreating.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If neither player has ships in the active system after the final round of combat, the Floating Factory is not destroyed, and does not retreat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Saar player has their last ship destroyed during combat by a &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card, a Floating Factory in the system will be blockaded and destroyed, even if the Saar player produced enough hits to destroy their opponent&amp;rsquo;s remaining ships during that round of combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Players alternate using the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability of their units, one at a time, starting with the active player, and continuing until both players decline, in a row, to use the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; of one of their units. If both the Saar player and their opponent have a &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt;, then the first unit to use &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; will be the first unit that may be destroyed by a &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt;. If the Saar player&amp;rsquo;s unit is the last to be destroyed, and leaves no other ships in the system, then a Floating Factory in that system will not be blockaded nor destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When resolving an ability of the &lt;i&gt;Construction&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, the Saar player must control a planet in the system they place a Floating Factory in.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an effect allows a Floating Factory to move through a system that contains another player&amp;rsquo;s ships (such as the &lt;i&gt;Light/Wave Deflectors&lt;/i&gt; technology), it will not be blockaded in systems it moves through.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a Floating Factory is in a system that contains none of the Saar player&amp;rsquo;s ships, and another player moves ships into that system, the Floating Factory is immediately destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This will happen before the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; step. The Floating Factory is destroyed, even if all of the other player&amp;rsquo; ships are destroyed during this step. Additionally, the Saar player cannot use that Floating Factory to resolve a space cannon roll enabled by the &lt;i&gt;Experimental Battlestation&lt;/i&gt; action card.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If all of the other player&amp;rsquo;s ships are removed due to a gravity rift, they will not arrive in the active system. The Floating Factory will not be destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A Floating Factory cannot count towards the &lt;i&gt;Improve Infrastructure&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Protect the Border&lt;/i&gt; objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Son of Ragh &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Captain Mendosa &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Saar player does not decide to use this ability until after the other player has activated a system. Any deal made to use this ability before the system has been activated is non&amp;ndash;binding.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The effect of Captain Mendosa occurs when the system is activated. The move value will be set to the chosen ship&amp;rsquo;s move value during this window.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Move value modifying effects that trigger after a system is activated, such as the &lt;i&gt;Flank Speed&lt;/i&gt; action card or the &lt;i&gt;Gravity Drive&lt;/i&gt; technology will not be included in Captain Mendosa&amp;rsquo;s effect.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Gravity rifts apply the +1 during movement. This modifier will not be included in Captain Mendosa&amp;rsquo;s effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The nebula effect of setting the move value of all ships in that system to one will be overwritten by Captain Mendosa&amp;rsquo;s effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Rowl Sarring &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Gurno Aggero &amp;mdash; Armageddon Relay &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A unit is not adjacent to the system it is in.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Scavenger Zeta &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Saar player may perform the &lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt; ability or their &lt;sc&gt;Scavenge&lt;/sc&gt; ability in either order. If they perform their &lt;sc&gt;Scavenge&lt;/sc&gt; ability first, they may pay for the &lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt; ability with the gained trade good.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the Saar player gains control of a planet that is not already controlled by another player, they will explore it before the &lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt; ability will be able to trigger.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Saar player gains control of multiple planets, they may deploy one Scavenger Zeta to each.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="TheCouncilKeleres_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;&gt;Across the galaxy, planetary governors compete for trade opportunities, the Great Civilizations joust for superiority on the battlefront,
and still other, more insidious factions play at shaping galactic history
for their own ends. In a galaxy fraught with so many agendas, it’s no
surprise that the Galactic Council took it upon itself to assemble a
force of its own to manage its affairs. The Keleres of the Council are
that force, but they are also something more. They are a ragtag army of
bureaucrats, soldiers, and spies, often at odds with themselves and not
always appreciated by the galaxy they serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the Keleres are born of the Galactic Council, they are often
left to their own devices, traveling the galaxy brokering peace, intervening in conflicts, and tackling threats to galactic civilization as a
whole. They even act without the consent of the Tribunii or the Galactic Council when timeliness is a factor, only to be censured by the
Galactic Council after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The member states of the Council send recruits, who are selected
according to the traditions of each individual planet or system, to
serve in the Keleres. The Great Powers have learned, since the Keleres’s
founding, that the Keleres are a useful tool for furthering their own
designs. Rather than sending their best operatives away to the Keleres,
many send political opponents, incompetents, dangerous prisoners,
and other individuals who are difficult to do away with and undesirable to have around. On the other hand, a few Great Powers find it
prudent to send highly competent personnel, sometimes out of respect
for the Galactic Council but more often than not to clandestinely advance their own goals. The Keleres, then, are a strange and difficult
order to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Galactic Council elects three of its own to be the Tribunii of the
Keleres. Members of the Council treat the responsibility with mixed
sentiment: as both an honor and a burden. The Tribunii have the
power to command the Keleres and to implement the designs of the
Galactic Council in a concrete way. However, the mixed quality of the
Keleres means having to accept no small number of failures, which, in
turn, can hurt the Tribunii when members of the Galactic Council seek
accountability. Canny Tribunii, such as Tribunii Kuuasi Aun Jalatai,
learn when best to use the Keleres, when to set them aside, and who
among the ranks are right for the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fraught political environment means that most Councilors
don’t serve as Tribunii long. In the five years since the Keleres’ founding, there have been seven Tribunii, including the current holders of
the office. Two were forced to resign in disgrace, one was killed on a
mission, and one was assassinated in an intra-agency power struggle.
For those Tribunii who meet and overcome the challenge of utilizing
the force of the Keleres, however, the fruits are significant indeed. It
requires much talent for this to happen, but when it does, it can tip the
balance of the Galactic Council itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three Tribunii who currently serve are in delicate balance, and
therefore the future of the Keleres and the Imperium itself may be at
a tipping point. Kuuasi is oldest and wisest among them. Harka Leeds
is as ambitious and cunning as she is ruthless in her schemes. Odlynn
Myrr, though new to the role, brings a fresh perspective and hope for
unity and stability in the Imperium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the delicate balance of power between the Tribunii, the
Keleres represent the Galactic Council and, as such, must embody the
unity of the galaxy, not just the whims of its leaders. The Great Civilizations, however, frequently compete with one another in trade, war,
and politics. Though some conflict can cement the bonds of a society,
too much can just as easily rip it apart. Thus, the diverse skills of the
Keleres are brought to bear on missions of peace and negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times, the Keleres act as a neutral party or temporary ally among
factions at war. Negotiation, knowledge of history, and familiarity with
alien species pave the way to peace and prosperity for the galaxy. They
broker peace on the one hand, but join battles on the other, especially
when violence seems to be the only means to stability.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="TheCouncilKeleres_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;h1&gt;The Tribunii&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Keleres player chooses their starting technology after all other players, including the Argent and Winnu players, have gained their starting technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If there are not two unique starting technologies amongst those owned by other players, the Keleres player will start the game with fewer technologies. This will most commonly happen in a three player game, where one of the other players is playing as N&amp;rsquo;orr or Winnu.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Council Patronage&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Keleres player must mandatorily replenish their commodities and gain a trade good every strategy phase.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Keleres player already has two commodities, they will still replenish their commodities during the strategy phase. This will not give them additional commodities, but will trigger any effects that happen when the Keleres player replenishes their commodities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If another player is holding the Keleres player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Trade Agreement&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, they may use it when the Keleres player replenishes commodities from &lt;sc&gt;Council Patronage&lt;/sc&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Law&amp;rsquo;s Order&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The blanked laws come back into effect at the end of the turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If this ability is used, all laws are blanked. The Keleres player cannot choose for some laws to remain in effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Keleres player owns the &lt;i&gt;Political Censure&lt;/i&gt; law, they will not lose a victory point when it is blanked, and they may use action cards during this turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Keleres player then uses the &lt;i&gt;Repeal Law&lt;/i&gt; action card, targeting the &lt;i&gt;Political Censure&lt;/i&gt; law, then it will be discarded without the Keleres player losing the victory point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Keleres player and all of the other players treat all laws as blank for the turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Keleres Rider &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After playing &lt;i&gt;Keleres Rider&lt;/i&gt;, a player may use additional abilities, including playing other rider cards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any other riders may be played to predict the same or a different outcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The effect of a successful &lt;i&gt;Keleres Rider&lt;/i&gt; will be resolved after the effect of the agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player who cannot vote may still play a &lt;i&gt;Keleres Rider&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player who cannot play action cards may still play a &lt;i&gt;Keleres Rider&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Agency Supply Network &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any abilities that trigger &amp;ldquo;when/after a unit uses &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt;&amp;rdquo; will trigger an additional time, for example, the &lt;i&gt;Sarween Tools&lt;/i&gt; technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The additional &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability cannot belong to the same unit as the original &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;During a tactical action, the active player must use every &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability of their units in the active system, or none of them. As such, the additional &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability must belong to a unit in a different system.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When the Keleres player resolves the secondary ability of the Warfare strategy card, they use the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability of a single space dock in their home system. As such, they may use the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability of a second unit in their home system, if present.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Keleres player may use Custodia Vigilia as the additional &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability, and when they use Custodia Vigilia as the original &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability, they may use an additional &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The original &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability must be fully resolved, before the Keleres player may use an additional &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Keleres player cannot pay one resource for two fighters or infantry, then place one with a unit using the original &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability and one with the unit using the additional &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;I.I.H.Q. Modernization &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Keleres player is neighbors with another player, that player is neighbors with the Keleres player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Custodia Vigilia &lt;sub&gt;(Legendary Planet)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Custodia Vigilia planet card is gained exhausted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Units cannot be placed on Custodia Vigilia.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Custodia Vigilia is not adjacent to any system, unit, player or other planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Keleres player cannot lose control of Custodia Vigilia.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Keleres player cannot be eliminated once they control Custodia Vigilia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Custodia Vigilia may be used to qualify for objectives, if it meets any other requirements listed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custodia Vigilia cannot be used to qualify for any objective that requires planets in a system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Custodia Vigilia may be elected by any &amp;ldquo;elect planet&amp;rdquo; agendas. However, Custodia Vigilia may be immune to the effects of the agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player gains victory points from the Imperial strategy card only if they control Mecatol Rex. If they use the Imperial strategy card to score an objective, then they gain victory points from that objective, and not the Imperial strategy card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Keleres player may use a command token to perform the secondary of Imperial during the same strategic action that they gained that token.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the Keleres player uses the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability of Custodia Vigilia, it is treated as though the Keleres player was using the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; abilitiy of one of their units on Mecatol Rex.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This may trigger the abilities of the &lt;i&gt;Sarween Tools&lt;/i&gt; technology, and other similar abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Custodia Vigilia counts towards scoring the &lt;i&gt;Produce en Masse&lt;/i&gt; objective within the Mecatol Rex system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Ul player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Terraform&lt;/i&gt; faction promissory note may be attached to Custodia Vigilia.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If &lt;i&gt;Terraform&lt;/i&gt; is attached to Custodia Vigilia, it may be explored. However, Custodia Vigilia may be immune to the effects of some exploration cards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Artemiris &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player cannot spend two influence, they cannot activate the system containing the &lt;i&gt;Artemiris&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Xander Alexin Victori III &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Xander Alexin Victori III applies to only a single instance of spending trade goods.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Suffi An &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The trade good to unlock Suffi An is spent after, and independent of, any trade goods spent while resolving the action card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Keleres player uses their additional action to perform another component action, they may perform another additional action. They may do this any number of times.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Harka Leeds &amp;mdash; Erwan&amp;rsquo;s Covenant &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Kuuasi Aun Jalatai &amp;mdash; Overwing Zeta &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Keleres player must be participating in the combat in order to resolve &lt;i&gt;Overwing Zeta&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player wishes to place a ship, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a ship of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Overwing Zeta&lt;/i&gt; may be played at the start of any round of combat, not just the first.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Overwing Zeta&lt;/i&gt; may be played in a round following the &lt;i&gt;Artemiris&lt;/i&gt; being destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Odlynn Myrr &amp;mdash; Operation Archon &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The additional votes are not cast until the Keleres player casts votes normally.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Keleres player may vote for a different outcome than the one they predicted. If they do, they will gain one trade good and one command token.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Omniopiares &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a planet contains multiple mechs, the invading player must pay one influence for each, as separate payments. For example, if all four mechs were on a planet, the invading player could only exhaust Meer to pay for one instance of the ability; they would still have three instances of a single influence to pay.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;All young Dih-Mohn learn of the Great Calamity. In the time before the time of their grandfathers’ grandfathers the Dih-Mohn believed they were masters of their own fate; that it was their destiny to one day conquer the stars, not knowing the dangers the galaxy held. These times were cut short when a massive asteroid evaded their early warning systems and collided with their ancient homeworld. Dust covered the planet, choking the remaining life on land, and providing the perfect opportunity for their once-docile ocean-dwelling slave force to revolt. Accepting they would need to take to the stars to survive, the Flotilla was constructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without faster than light travel, the search for a new home would take generations, but they had no choice. Centuries passed without success, enough time that each new generation born in space adapted to their unnatural environment little by little. Over time they developed into the haunting stretched and pale forms they are now known for. Despite the age of the fleet, the Flotilla remained functional due to the heroic achievements of its engineering crews. Their search for a new home would have continued indefinitely had it not been for the discovery of a fleet of ancient derelict ships, the remains of a long-forgotten battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broken memory of an ancient battle, the salvage was a treasure-trove of knowledge. New weapons, armor, robotics, and (most importantly) the discovery of a functioning drive. The Flotilla quickly set about overhauling its own ships to incorporate these new technologies, and in a few short years the Flotilla had transformed from an aging steel coffin to a formidable force. Crucially, the fleet was now capable of faster than light travel, and with renewed optimism they made their first jump to a new colonization prospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No sooner had the fleet entered the system than it was attacked by hostile forces. Roving pirates searching for easy marks had mistaken the ancient drive signatures of the Dih-Mohn Flotilla for merchant ships, and had laid a trap. Scrambling to form defensive positions the start of the battle looked grim for the Flotilla. Battle-damaged ships were quickly rotated back into the core of the formation for repairs and losses were mounting. As the engagement drew on, the Dih-Mohn stabilized. The pirates were unprepared for the ancient technologies and well-refined engineering of the Dih-Mohn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses were high within the Flotilla that day, but they eventually found victory, and were able to claim their new home. Abyssus lies within the newly-christened New Rest system, and has quickly became a nearly-religious icon for the denizens of the Flotilla. If the fleet was their father, Abyssus was their mother: one firm, the other giving, and both loving. However, after their long journey, the Dih-Mohn found colonization proved difficult. Their bodies had adapted, and many Dih-Mohn chose to remain on the Flotilla due to the physical pain of living in a gravity well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centuries later, the Dih-Mohn have grown into their new home, with the population on New Rest nearly matching that which remains in the Flotilla. As the years pass, however, the Dih-Mohn grow increasingly restless, with those who lead the Flotilla arguing that the true destiny of the Dih-Mohn is to return to the stars - to find yet more new homes and protect their people indefinitely, or to show the galaxy what the might of the Flotilla is capable of.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Mystical diplomats, Elegant sages, Authority incarnate. The Edyn are, according to galactic records, an anomaly. No account from outside sources exists which mentions their presence prior to the return of the Mahact, and yet according to the Edyn, and by all appearances, their culture is ancient, their technology unfathomably advanced, and their insight into galactic politics nearly unparalleled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual Edyn are often described as having an enchanting physical presence, radiating a sense of reserved authority and having a calming familiar nature. Though their communication is at times cryptic, it is always earnest, kind, and patient. Their culture is apparently governed by a complex moral philosophy and societal doctrine they refer to only as "The Mandate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mandate is the central pillar around which all of Edyn society is structured. Initially believed to be some form of ideology, initial observations indicate the Mandate is a perceptible force which acts upon physical reality via an incomprehensibly complex and vast techno-arcane network. To the Edyn, the Mandate is absolute, and violation of it would result in immediate severance from the sustaining force which permeates every facet of their existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most tangible evidence of this lies with the Mandate's chosen avatar among the Edyn, the Living Will. This being is one who can wield the full power of the Mandate, accomplishing feats which defy all description short of sorcery. Stories say that a single stride can carry it across the galaxy, a mere wave of its hand can terraform planets, and a simple word can unify the hearts of all present in one just cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Edyn speak little of their past, but all recorded discussion of the subject follows a similar pattern: once, they looked to the stars with hope they were not alone; then, some of their kind "fell" from the Mandate or lost their way; now, they have arrived to ensure the fundamental "order" of the universe is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Edyn space is home to one of the most diverse populations in the galaxy. The Edyn’s eponymous home planet is a bustling ecumenopolis, serving as a hub of diplomacy, refuge, and political influence. This rapid rise to prominence leaves their apparent prior isolation all that much more of an unresolved mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to their first contact, navigation of the uncharted space near the Edyn’s home system was deemed impossible due to the extremely anomalous space being entirely impassable. Now however, the path to Edyn space has become significantly easier to traverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did not take long for the Edyn to be admitted to the galactic council, and their role on it has consistently been marked by a strong affinity for law and order. Now, successful council resolutions are drafted with assistance of Edyn officials, and resolutions which might run against Edyn interests have a tendency to stall in committees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors have started to spread that the Mandate is mobilizing its forces for war. However, it remains unclear if they intend to actually make a traditional play for the imperial throne, or continue to push legislation and pursue their own hidden objectives. Recent resolutions indicate that the Edyn intend to bind the entire galaxy under the Mandate, regardless of who may officially ascend the throne.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="TheEmbersOfMuaat_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;It was during the early years of the Age of Dusk that Jol-Nar
explorers came upon the volcanic planet of Muaat. Scouting
for resources beyond the Mahact Plateau, the explorers were
amazed by the mineral wealth of their discovery, but they
were truly awestruck by the extraordinary qualities of the
planet’s fiery inhabitants, the Gashlai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gashlai were unlike any race known to the Jol-Nar:
sentient beings with bodies slowly consumed by a fiery
heat. After their conception, the Gashlai cocooning process
somehow enables conversion of energy into mass—a process
hinted at by scientific theory, but forever thought unattainable
on a sub-cosmic scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jol-Nar benefited greatly from Muaat’s resources, yet
they were frustrated in their attempts to replicate the Gashlai
cocooning process. Instead, the Gashlai proved useful as
slave labor, as the Headmasters transformed the orbit of
Muaat into a massive shipyard for their navy. It was here, at
the Muaat shipyards, that the construction of a secret Jol-Nar
superweapon began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gashlai suffered tragically under their enslavement
by the Jol-Nar, but events of the early Twilight Wars would
dramatically change their ill fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after the Twilight Wars erupted, a Jol-Nar expedition
party searching for mineral deposits on Muaat became
infected by an organism in the Doolak Mountains. The
infection developed into a disease later known as the Doolak
plague. The covert, yet frequent, traffic between Muaat and
the Garian star system allowed for the spread of the virus to
the Jol Nar home worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plague became one of the greatest disasters in JolNar history, and only the early research of Gashlai biology
allowed the Headmasters to devise a vaccine before the entire
Jol-Nar population was destroyed. Before the Jol-Nar could
recover from this disaster, their military offensive collapsed,
and soon the Headmasters would face the ruthless advance of
the Sardakk N’orr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Jol-Nar navy retreated, the Headmasters were
forced to call forth their secret weapon at Muaat. This
weapon—an enormous battle vessel called the “War Sun”—
was not yet entirely complete, but with their fates clinging to
the defenses of the Saudor system, the Headmasters had no
choice but to bring it to bear against the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the War Sun left its Muaat moorings, and as the majority
of the remaining Jol-Nar personnel left with it, the Gashlai
finally carved their own destiny. Having long schemed against
their enslavers, they incinerated the remaining Jol-Nar in the
system, capturing the shipyard and every available scientific
document left behind by their hated oppressors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Not long after their
costly victory at Saudor, the
Jol-Nar sought to return to their
colony at Muaat, but found that all
communications with the system had
been severed. Exploratory ships sent to
Muaat would not return. Though the Headmasters suspected
what might have taken place on their old colony, they were
unable to return there in force again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the long Dark Years, the Gashlai prospered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clad in Ember suits, special body armor shielding the
Gashlai from the cold and others from their lethal heat, a
large assembly of Gashlai envoys have recently arrived at
Mecatol Rex, demanding recognition and representation. The
High Fire Warden Sushon Azh has simultaneously sent forth
Gashlai ambassadors to all the great races in the distinctive
gold-bronze frigates of the Gashlai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet one such ambassador did not arrive in a frigate. As the
Gashlai ambassador assigned to the Jol-Nar sailed past the
Garian star and began his approach to Jol, the Headmasters
paled in fear, for this representative arrived in a War Sun, a
copy of their own ancient designs. The message was not
wasted on the Headmasters. Their former slaves had become
formidable, and they had not forgotten, or forgiven, the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by the Fire Wardens, the Gashlai are resolved to never
be enslaved again. Inside their golden Ember suits they burn
with ambition. The Jol-Nar fear what the rest of the galaxy is
about to learn: that the Embers of Muaat intend to bring their
fire to the furthest reaches of space, burning the unwilling
into submission.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    &lt;li&gt;No unit is using its &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability. The &lt;i&gt;Sarween Tools&lt;/i&gt; technology and similar effects will not allow a more expensive ship to be produced.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If ground forces are produced, they may be placed in the space area or on a planet the player controls in the system with their war sun or flagship.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Naalu or Yin players are chosen, and choose to produce fighters or infantry, they will only be able to produce two of those units; their commander will have no effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Regulated Conscription&lt;/i&gt; law is in play, then that player may use their commander to produce two units for one resource when resolving Umbat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Magmus &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a command token is spent to resolve the secondary ability of a strategy card, the trade good is gained after resolving the secondary ability. As such, it cannot be spent to pay for costs of the secondary ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Muaat player spends multiple tokens from their strategy pool (e.g. for the &lt;i&gt;Lead From the Front&lt;/i&gt; objective), they gain that many trade goods, one at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Each trade good gained may trigger the Mentak player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; faction ability.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Muaat player wishes to score &lt;i&gt;Lead From the Front&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Form a Spy Network&lt;/i&gt; during the one status phase, they must do so simultaneously, and both happen before the Mentak player may use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; faction ability. If the Mentak player subsequently uses their agent, Suffi An, when they use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; faction ability on the trade goods the Muaat player gained from Magmus when spending the tokens for &lt;i&gt;Lead From the Front&lt;/i&gt;, then the Muaat player cannot discard the drawn action card for &lt;i&gt;Form a Spy Network&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Muaat player uses the ability of the &lt;i&gt;Scepter of Emelpar&lt;/i&gt; relic, they will be unable to benefit from the ability of Magmus.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Adjudicator Ba&amp;rsquo;al &amp;mdash; Nova Seed &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any method of movement is sufficient to trigger this ability, not only tactical action movement. For example, the Muaat player may trigger &lt;i&gt;Nova Seed&lt;/i&gt; when they retreat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player moves the Muaat player&amp;rsquo;s war sun via the use of their &lt;i&gt;Benediction&lt;/i&gt; hero ability, the Muaat player cannot trigger &lt;i&gt;Nova Seed&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the war sun is in the target system when it is activated, it must move out of the system, and back in, for &lt;i&gt;Nova Seed&lt;/i&gt; to be able to be triggered.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any command tokens, frontier tokens and the Muaat player&amp;rsquo;s units on the replaced system tile are transferred to the new supernova tile. Any Creuss wormhole tokens are returned to the Creuss player and any Ul sleeper tokens are returned to the Ul player. All other tokens are purged.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Muaat player&amp;rsquo;s units may exist in and move out of the supernova system, even if the Muaat player does not own &lt;i&gt;Magmus Reactor&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Muaat player owns &lt;i&gt;Magmus Reactor &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt;, and resolves this ability during a tactical action, they will be able to produce units during the &lt;b&gt;Production&lt;/b&gt; step, if the Muaat player still has units in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nova Seed&lt;/i&gt; cannot target the home system of an eliminated player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nova Seed&lt;/i&gt; may target the Creuss Gate (tile 17) or the Wormhole Nexus (tile 82).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Empyrean player cannot use the ability of their agent, Acamar, on the Muaat player after they use &lt;i&gt;Nova Seed&lt;/i&gt; if the original system tile contained planets.&#x16;&lt;/li&gt;

the warehousing, logistics, maintenance, banking,
entertainment, and other necessities facilitating the
constant flow of goods, ships, and crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface of the three hot desert planets,
life is slower and more serene. Only life in the city of
Harcarun on the planet Arretze matches the breathless
pace of the space above. Located in a shadowy vale
near the Arretze northern pole, Harcarun is the only
city in the tri-system that has a fixed position. Its
permanent location and almost bearable climate has
made Harcarun the primary point of operation for
most non-native trading corporations, financiers,
and opportunists. The Hacan, despite their uncanny
ability for establishing financial relationships and
building trade, generally despise the chaotic lifestyle
and, to them, windy cold of Harcarun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hacan people dwell mostly in cities built
on massive dust-sleds, constantly moving to cooler
climates as the desert seasons shift. Although some
technology has been introduced in the last hundred
years, most Hacan cities are still pulled by vast herds
of Tuuran beasts, whose gill-like skin membranes
take moisture from the very air itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their distant past, the
Hacan were a poor species,
their exploits into space dwarfed
by the other great races of the
Imperium. Then slowly the Hacan discovered an
insatiable off-worlder lust for special products
grown under Kenara’s blinding light or dug from the
deep sands of their homeworlds. The intoxicating
gerr root, clothes made from the starflowers
that only rise during Hercant’s equinox, Spehat
aphrodisiacs, liquors, medicines, and forbidden
drugs: all harvested and manufactured by the crafty
and patient hands of the Hacan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon the Hacan became masters of trade, and their
system prospered as unfathomable fortunes were
made by the increasingly powerful trading clans, chief
among them the Mowshir Emirate of Arretze. The
desire to protect their newfound wealth, and a will to
peacefully regulate and arbitrate between the clans,
moved the Hacan to form a representative gathering
and to elect a Quieron—the leader who speaks for all
the Hacan. The Quieron leads the entire hierarchy
of trade-groups, each possessing its own fleets of
commerce and war. His task: to lead his people to the
Imperial Throne, establishing an era of wealth and
peaceful commerce.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;h1&gt;Masters of Trade&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Hacan player has the Muaat player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, they will not gain a trade good from it when they use their Masters of Trade ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Guild Ships&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This ability does not make the Hacan player neighbors with all other players.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Either player may initiate negotiations for a transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Hacan player is still limited to one transaction with every other player per turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Arbiters&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any number of action cards may be traded.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may receive action cards even if doing so would put them over the seven action card hand limit. They must immediately discard down to seven action cards in this case.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Hacan player has more than seven action cards, they must immediately discard down to seven action cards. They cannot trade away the excess.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Hacan player has their &lt;i&gt;Political Secret&lt;/i&gt; played during an agenda, they may still trade action cards, as &lt;sc&gt;Arbiters&lt;/sc&gt; is a passive ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Trade Convoys &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This ability does not make the player neighbors with all other players.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Either player may initiate negotiations for a transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The player with &lt;i&gt;Trade Convoys&lt;/i&gt; in play is still limited to one transaction with every other player per turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trade Convoys&lt;/i&gt; has no effect while it is in a player&amp;rsquo;s hand.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trade Convoys&lt;/i&gt; is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Hacan player this turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Activating a system containing only the Hacan player&amp;rsquo;s structures will still cause &lt;i&gt;Trade Convoys&lt;/i&gt; to be returned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Hacan player&amp;rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/i&gt; strategy card), this will not cause &lt;i&gt;Trade Convoys&lt;/i&gt; to be returned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Production Biomes &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Quantum Datahub Node &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If either strategy card had trade goods on it at the start of the strategy phase, those trade goods remain with the player that originally chose the strategy card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In a three&amp;ndash; or four&amp;ndash;player game, the Hacan player chooses which strategy cards are swapped.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Hacan player must have three trade goods before they spend the command token; they cannot use the Muaat player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note to gain the third trade good.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrath of Kenara &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This ability may be triggered only once for each die rolled. The Hacan player cannot spend two (or more) trade goods to apply +2 (or more) to a single die, but they may spend two (or more) trade goods to apply +1 to each of two (or more) dice.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Carth of Golden Sands &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player that has their maximum number of commodities may have their commodities replenished. If this happens, they will take no commodities. However, they will still trigger any &amp;ldquo;when [this] player replenishes commodities&amp;rdquo; effects, most notably the &lt;i&gt;Trade Agreement&lt;/i&gt; promissory note.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Hacan player cannot have more than six commodities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The ability of Carth of Golden Sands cannot be resolved while another ability is resolving. For example, if the Hacan player is exploring an industrial planet and has revealed the card, they cannot use the ability of Carth of Golden Sands until after they resolve the card&amp;rsquo;s effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Gila the Silvertongue &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Additional votes must be cast for the same outcome as the other votes the Hacan player cast.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Hacan player abstains or otherwise casts zero votes, they cannot cast additional votes.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If another player has the Hacan player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, their additional votes must be cast for the same outcome they cast their other votes for.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="TheEmpyrean_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Since time immemorial, travelers have told tales of the Empyrean, enigmatic beings who live in the depths of space. The oldest Jol-Nar libraries have references to faceless creatures who sailed the void long before the Hylar left their watery cradle. Winnaran custodians still maintain fragmented historical documents that managed to survive the ancient Sol bombardment and suggest that the Empyrean predate the discovery of supraluminal travel, a technology so old that no race has presented credible evidence that they invented it first. If these records are to be believed, the Empyrean have been crossing the vast gulf of space in sublight vessels for tens of thousands of years before the first FTL drives made galactic civilization possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not this is true, historians agree that whenever a species establishes colonies beyond their homeworld, the Empyrean arrive to observe their progress. They tend to lurk on the edges of star systems, making no effort to announce their presence. They can remain drifting in the outer cometary halos for centuries, occasionally sending unobtrusive probes orbiting through the inner system for closer observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though they do not actively avoid confrontations, anthropologists and diplomats who have attempted to establish contact with the Empyrean tend to find them frustratingly noncommunicative. Individual Empyrean tend to avoid answering questions about their purpose in observing the actions of other species, or about themselves or their civilization. Though they are sometimes referred to as the galaxy’s “historians,” nobody knows if the Empyrean keep a unified record of galactic events. If they do, they have not shared it with anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of what is known of the Empyrean has been gleaned through direct observation. The most startling fact about them is that they are a species who survive in space. Their ships have no pressurized compartments, and beyond some radiation and debris protection, are completely exposed to vacuum. The Empyrean themselves have no visible sensory organs or orifices, and seem to spend much of their time absorbing starlight with the great leathery wings that protrude from their backs. Their body shape does suggest that they evolved on a planet’s surface, leading some scientists to suggest that their original home may have been largely airless. Others believe that at some point in the distant past, the Empyrean were a more traditional avian species who biocrafted themselves to thrive in the vacuum of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever their origins, most species find interacting with the Empyrean difficult. Communication isn’t a problem— individual Empyrean are able to broadcast radio waves that can be picked up by most standard comms devices—but patience is. The Empyrean act slowly and deliberately, perhaps a consequence of subsisting on the meager solar energy of stars, or possibly because of their extremely long lifespans. They can spend hours or even days contemplating an answer to a single question. In addition, Empyrean society seems to operate as a form of communal anarchy. They make decisions based on the consensus of all Empyrean currently present. They seem cooperative enough that this works, but it does mean governments have no way to negotiate with the “whole of the Empyrean people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They do, however, make some effort to engage with other sentients, such as donning clothing to make guests feel at ease. They also engage in trade for rare metals and trace elements in exchange for new astronomical and scientific information. Most species tend to ignore the Empyrean unless they seek some esoteric knowledge, or the Empyrean approach them first.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, more and more black-winged Empyrean ships have begun to gather near major trade lanes and on the outskirts of civilized systems. Some free traders have begun to refuse to follow the deep space commerce trails, repeating rumors that ships have begun to vanish in greater numbers, and Empyrean craft have been sighted following lone vessels. One Empyrean ship has even traveled to Mecatol Rex, and individuals who say they speak for the Empyrean have engaged in long meetings with the Winnarans in Mecatol City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These representatives say they believe the galaxy will soon be engulfed by a storm worse than the Twilight Wars of a millennia ago. They maintain that the struggle for the throne will tear the galaxy to shreds, and that none of the rising powers have the mandate or the moral authority to rule over their fellows. Instead, the Empyrean have come to believe that only a truly neutral arbitrator can hope to rule a galactic Empire; an arbitrator that already knows all other species better than they know themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="TheEmpyrean_Notes" xml:space="preserve">

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This effect also applies outside the &lt;b&gt;Movement&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Empyrean player treats nebulae as nebulae and as anomalies for all other game purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the Empyrean player is the defender during a space combat in a nebula, they will receive the +1 to their combat rolls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Aetherpassage&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Empyrean player does not decide to use this ability until after the other player has activated a system. Any deal made to use this ability before the system has been activated is non&amp;ndash;binding.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dark Whispers&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Blood Pact &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Both players must cast at least one vote to trigger the additional votes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If either player cannot vote on an agenda, then the additional votes will not trigger for that agenda.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blood Pact&lt;/i&gt; has no effect while it is in a player&amp;rsquo;s hand.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blood Pact&lt;/i&gt; is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Empyrean player this turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Activating a system containing only the Empyrean player&amp;rsquo;s structures will still cause &lt;i&gt;Blood Pact&lt;/i&gt; to be returned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Empyrean player&amp;rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/i&gt; strategy card), this will not cause &lt;i&gt;Blood Pact&lt;/i&gt; to be returned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dark Pact &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot have more commodities than their commodity value.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Empyrean player plays a player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Trade Agreement&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, this will count for that player giving the Empyrean player all their commodities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The trade goods gained from &lt;i&gt;Dark Pact&lt;/i&gt; are gained simultaneously with the commodities transacted between the two players. As a pair of players is limited to one transaction per turn (which must involve the active player) or per agenda, the two players cannot then perform a transaction for these trade goods on the same turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;As the trade goods from &lt;i&gt;Dark Pact&lt;/i&gt; are gained simultaneously with any commodities and/or trade goods transacted, the Mentak player may only use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability on each player once per &lt;i&gt;Dark Pact&lt;/i&gt; transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dark Pact&lt;/i&gt; has no effect while it is in a player&amp;rsquo;s hand.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dark Pact&lt;/i&gt; is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Empyrean player this turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Activating a system containing only the Empyrean player&amp;rsquo;s structures will still cause &lt;i&gt;Dark Pact&lt;/i&gt; to be returned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Empyrean player&amp;rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/i&gt; strategy card), this will not cause &lt;i&gt;Dark Pact&lt;/i&gt; to be returned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Aetherstream &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Empyrean player does not decide to use this ability until after the other player has activated a system. Any deal made to use this ability before the system has been activated is non&amp;ndash;binding.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A system is not adjacent to itself. If a system with an anomaly is activated, &lt;i&gt;Aetherstream&lt;/i&gt; will not give any ships +1 to their move value, unless that system is adjacent to another anomaly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Voidwatch &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The active player chooses which promissory note they give the Empyrean player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dynamo &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A unit may only use its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability once in each &lt;b&gt;Assign Hits&lt;/b&gt; step, even if it is repaired.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A unit that becomes damaged without using its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability will not trigger this effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may play a &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card during the same timing window as this ability. If they do so, the ship is destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each unit using its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability creates a separate timing window. As such, any excess influence used to repair a ship is wasted, and cannot be used to repair a different ship.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;As an example, The Dark may be exhausted to repair only one ship, not two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Acamar &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Exhausting Acamar is a cost. Acamar cannot be used if it is exhausted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A system that contains a planet destroyed by the &lt;i&gt;Stellar Converter&lt;/i&gt; relic, and no other planets, is considered to contain no planets.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Xuange &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;While the agenda phase and the Hacan player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Trade Convoys&lt;/i&gt; promissory note allow a player to resolve transactions with all other players, they do not make that player neighbors with all other players.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any movement of ships can trigger this ability, not just movement during the &lt;b&gt;Move Ships&lt;/b&gt; step of a tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Empyrean player becomes neighbors with all players when the final player moves ships into a system containing one of the Empyrean player&amp;rsquo;s command tokens, Xuange will unlock, but the Empyrean player will not be able to resolve its ability from that movement.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Conservator Procyon &amp;mdash; Multiverse Shift &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Empyrean player chooses the order of exploration.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A system that contains a planet destroyed by the &lt;i&gt;Stellar Converter&lt;/i&gt; relic, and no other planets, is considered to contain no planets. &lt;i&gt;Multiverse Shift&lt;/i&gt; will place a frontier token in such a system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Watcher &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This effect may cancel a &lt;i&gt;Sabotage&lt;/i&gt; action card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Watcher must be adjacent to the other player&amp;rsquo;s units during the timing window when the action card is played in order to cancel it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In particular, if an action card is played &amp;ldquo;when/after you activate a system&amp;rdquo; or similar, then the Watcher must be adjacent before any ships move during that tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Nestled in the third orbit of the Sol system lies
Jord, the ancestral home of the human race. Few
planets can rival Jord’s diversity of climates, seasons,
and ecology. Much of this wealth is attributed to its
enormous moon, which causes dramatic tidal motions
in Jord’s oceans, which is thought to be the impetus of
its diverse life and weather patterns. Much of Jord’s
orbit, as well as its moon, is crowded with stellar traffic
from the orbital and lunar space stations. Military
ships of the line, bearing the distinctive Sol symbol,
are often moored to the bulky military platforms in
Jord’s orbit, or to the fleet base Churchill Prima that
orbits the reddish fourth planet of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The humans themselves represent the most
numerous and most diverse species of the galaxy. Since
the discovery of the mass-drive, humans have left Jord
to explore, and they continue to explore, the distant
corners of space. Humans can be found in all corners
of the galaxy and seem to demonstrate the greatest
variation in intellect and application of skills. Human
colonies and settlements can be found everywhere,
as can human servants, traders, cartographers,
explorers, mercenaries, scholars, construction crews,
smugglers, scientists, diplomats, etc. It is commonly
recognized among galactic historians that it has been
the diversified skills of the human race that has been
the determining factor in avoiding annihilation or
extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the untold billions of humans that dwell across
the galaxy, all of whose ancestors once migrated from
the Sol system, most feel no allegiance or kinship to
the Sol Federation or the humans of Jord. Some feel
a traditional friendship, while a few remain loyal to
Sol and its policies. Being the last civilization to be
admitted into the imperial council, it is ironic that Sol
was the first to openly declare war against the failing
empire. It was a Sol fleet that fired the first shot at the
Letnev blockade of the Quann wormhole, escalating
the minor conflict into the full scale galactic war that
was the Twilight Wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sol Federation of
Nations is governed by the biannually elected High Minister,
who has the executive control of the
economy, budget, and Sol military. The executive
powers of the High Minister are held in check by
three distinct governing houses: The House of Law,
The House of the People, and The House of Industry.
The four governing bodies of the Federation are all
centrally located in the massive metropolis of New
Moscow, a bustling center of politics, trade, and
high culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current High Minister, Juan Salvador Tao,
is preparing for a new age that he knows is rapidly
evolving before him. He is eager to expand the
official colonization of the Sol Federation once more,
especially to the old colonies of Centauri, Gral,
and Quann. He knows that the balance of power is
shifting and that the universe will soon once again be
governed under one empire. The High Minister will
make sure that his Federation will prevail during the
coming power struggle and inevitable war. Already
the Sol fleet awaits his orders to strike nearby
systems. Soon the human destiny will be fulfilled,
and the distant suns theirs to command.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    &lt;li&gt;The start of ground combat occurs after the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Defense&lt;/b&gt; step. If all of the ground forces committed to a planet are destroyed in that step, then the ground combat will be skipped on that planet, and this ability will not trigger.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Many wonder what drives the Florzen’s machinations and what some would call Faustian bargains. Some say galactic conquest, others say financial enrichment, still others claim a demonic desire for destruction. The truth, like in most mysteries, is less fantastical than the productions of the imagination. The Florzen are driven by an insatiable drive for knowledge of the past. The predominant religion of the Florzen sees the long desired “future of peace” as attainable only by uncovering and utilizing the secrets of the past. To achieve this “future of peace” the Florzen extend their tentacles deep into galactic politics, war profiteering, and humanitarian actions. All sectors are useful for this great purpose, and much intensive study is dedicated to utilizing relics in ways that would otherwise not be obvious to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florzen system is tucked away in a secluded part of space and is home to the two crown jewels of Kyd and Delmor; one an oceanic paradise, the other home to renowned mountainous vistas. Nobody is truly sure which of the two the Florzen originated from as they both float among the clouds and swim in the seas. Regardless of which is their home, the endemic populations of each world exist in a longstanding cooperative union with the Florzen. Although the Florzen System is home to many different species, the Florzen themselves are the ruling class. Conditions for non-Florzen are almost equal, though all governmental and administrative roles require a contract for a non-Florzen to be appointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florzen themselves possess a “head” which provides sight and houses their central nervous system, air sacks which inflate with helium, allowing the Florzen to traverse both sea and sky, as well as tentacles which vary wildly in length. They also possess a mysterious organ which is credited with “psychic” abilities ranging from telepathy to apparent mind control. Notably however, Florzen psychic talents seem to be limited, requiring a form of psychic contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychic contract is the tool upon which Florzen society is built. Contractors and contractees work together in conjunction to operate starships, run government, spy on other empires, and analyze relics. After agreement, the parties cannot cancel the contract until the time indicated arrives. Once made, these “pacts” as they're sometimes called, allow the Florzen to send subconscious suggestions to their contractee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;As finer, more direct control requires close proximity of the Florzen’s appendages, Florzen ship design has adapted to allow them to better take advantage of their talents. The larger ships are built around a single ancient Florzen, with tentacles running the corridors of the ship, allowing for tight control of its contractees during emergencies. The smaller ships are known as corsairs, and are often composed of a single younger Florzen without contractees. These corsairs venture out into the void to search for glory, contractees, and relics, and often sell their services to whoever might ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florzen spy organizations are commonly talked about only in hushed tones, and have inspired many rumors among the other empires of the galaxy. The little-understood methods of the Florzen often cause most to view them with suspicion and fear; however, the bargains they make are sometimes too good to refuse.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Just beyond Veldyr space lies the beating heart of a movement. The three-planet system known as Hope’s Heart acts as a hub of culture and symbolic seat of authority for the Free Systems Compact. The Compact itself is home to numerous peoples from across its member states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the galaxy’s attention turned to the rising threats of the Vuil’Raith and the Mahact’s return, a rebel movement brewed in the mines and factories of Idyn. As it gained momentum, the feelings of independence made headway on Idyn’s sister planet of Kroll, and among the elite of nearby Cyrr; in time, powerful and influential leaders across the system began to join together in the call for independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many back-channel talks, and surreptitious meetings among the movement’s leadership, Kroll formally declared its independence from the great empires, and promptly sent forces to liberate and occupy the other worlds in the system. Within a standard week, and without much bloodshed, the system was unified in independence. After extensive deliberation, the movement quickly reorganized into a representative democracy constituted of senators from each member world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a message broadcast across the galaxy, Count Odo P’May addressed his fellow new rebels, declaring Hope’s Heart a safe haven for all seeking refuge from tyranny, and promising the Compact would stand as an ally alongside any who choose to resist the oppression of the old powers. This broadcast has been regarded as a stunning masterwork of rhetoric. Soon numerous worlds had cast off the yoke of their distracted overlords and declared their allegiance with the Compact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many have hailed this movement as a historic opportunity for the galaxy to have a new start, and indeed they look on to see a brighter future, not all who look do so with earnestness and agreement. There are those who look on and see critically important worlds to the upstart faction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it remains to be seen if the Compact can manage to hold onto the freedom it has worked to hold on to and cherishes so dearly. Some argue it is only a matter of time before the Veldyr interests propping up its efforts, while others claim its light will inevitably grow dim. It is no secret that the Compact seeks to secure the Heart of the Galaxy and playing to the Count grows old, and its message resonates across the galaxy. This said, the Compact’s peoples stand united as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the Compact still struggles to survive the tides of war and the staunch resistance of far older galactic powers. It is only through their remarkable focus and meritocratic culture that they have managed to secure tentative peace domestically, representation on the galactic council, and declare their bid for the imperial throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Cyhn has been the subject of much propaganda both within Compact space and elsewhere; though she openly declares any interest in the imperial throne is purely altruistic—establishing a new democratic order for the galaxy—there are many who feel the goals of the Compact are not as pure as they may seem, and that their momentum may soon be all but impossible to halt.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;The Ghemina Raiders are one of the youngest powers in the galaxy, and have only recently named themselves so. Two independent separatist groups of Sol and Celdauri colonists had fled their home planets and ended up sharing the twin planets of Drah and Trykk in the same solar system. Through their shared experiences establishing independent societies on these highly-similar cold and forgotten planets, and with a survival culture steeped in rich lore gathered from their own histories, eventually the two colonies merged. To facilitate trust between the colonies, government and military representatives were paired, one from each colony. It was considered divine providence, then, when the colonists discovered that the environment and ecology of the system happened to strongly skew birth rates towards twins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling Lord and Lady rapidly proclaimed this a sign from the universe that their pragmatic pairings were favored by fate. Within a generation, twins became elevated in this developing culture, and the pairing of twins became central to Ghemina society. Highly trained twins produced tightly coordinated and strategically aligned strike teams, both in space and on the ground, making Ghemina one of the most terrifying adversaries for small fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These benefits did not go unnoticed by Ghemina leadership. The leadership of the united clans quietly invested scientific research and cultural enhancement groups, set toward encouraging even higher twin birth rates, as well as seeding a strong clan warrior pair ideology throughout families on both planets. Within just one more generation, Ghemina clans became warlike, strongly bonded, and contemptuous of their more recent human ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of their raiding parties quickly bent the Ghemina economy toward a raid-and-salvage model. Mechanized units now scour conquered planets for ancient sites or artifacts, combat pairs scream battle cries as they carve into terrified enemy infantry, and warships engage with uncanny coordination. Sol soldiers are known to mockingly dismiss the Ghemina as 'space vikings,' but only ever from afar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twins also showed their value in diplomatic engagements and Ghemina political efforts became much more successful. Indeed, two minds are often better than one, especially when individual tempers may flare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time, raids drive away easy prey. The Lord and Lady, sitting upon their twin thrones, in their twinned halls, have gathered the many clans together, readying them to expand and establish new raiding outposts. The Ghemina do not wish to expand their empire for its own sake, but few greater prizes remain than Rex itself. Surely, if they can establish a foothold there, who knows what untold wealth they could acquire, or how far their raiding parties could venture.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;They’re ghost stories. Frightful tales whispered to children
by nightcycle lamps. Dread accounts told to fellow sailors in
the humming darkness of long-haul freighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even now, in our growing enlightenment, when we know
so much more about the Shaleri passage and its strange
inhabitants, the sheer differentness of the Shaleri and its Ghosts
seduce such tales to persist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An almost endless variation of hearsay and rumor can
be found on the topic of the Shaleri anomaly. Rare records
of purported fact are, at best, of irregular verifiability. While
now a respected sociological study, what is truly known of the
Shaleri remains infinitely smaller than the abundance of myth
that clouds its past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For millennia, space in proximity of the Shaleri anomaly
has been mistrusted and avoided by spacefarers. Despite the
undeniable historic universality in avoiding this region, few
concrete explanations have been made as to the reason for such
aversion. Some simply denote the area as “high risk.” Others
conjecture that the area ebbs with “unknown radiation.”
Regrettably, most navigation records simply refer to the Shaleri
region as “bad space”—the superstitious space-faring analogy
of “here be dragons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is known for sure is that Shaleri space has over time
been responsible for an unusually high number of missing
vessels. An extraordinarily high number, in fact. For such a
high proportion of lost traffic the absence of distress beacons,
message capsules, or any signs whatsoever of the missing
ships has been described in official records as “disturbing.” It
is perhaps more aptly described, using a favored term of sailors
and storytellers, as spooky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mystery of the Shaleri region goes further and deeper
than just that of missing spaceships. Among crews that have
safely made journeys through the region, there are records
of strange equipment malfunctions, bad dreams, and sudden
illnesses. There are accounts of purported “sightings”: eldritch
encounters with beings described as strange fibrous clouds of
energy. While such accounts may have been dismissed in the
past as the fantasies of oxygen-deprived sailors, the hindsight
of the galaxy’s recent association with the Ghosts places these
reports in a more credible light.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several trade routes that when traced through rather
than around Shaleri space will save the traveler substantial time
and fuel. It follows, therefore, that willingness to brave its dark
reputation has come with substantial profit for those captains
who have dared to travel in this “bad space” and returned to tell
the tale. It was in pursuit of such profit that the Mentak frigate
Entropic undertook its fifth journey though Shaleri space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Entropic had been traveling through Shaleri space for
three days when it was interdicted by three formidable vessels
of unknown origin. The vessels, each the size of a Mentak
battlecruiser, were of grey lobstered steel, their surface intricately
inscribed with interweaving runic latticework. It is this meeting
between the Entropic and the Creuss warships that is marked as
First Contact between the Ghosts of Creuss and a member race
of the galactic council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not known why the
beings that dwell within
the Shaleri anomaly (now
commonly called the “Creuss
Gate”) chose to reveal themselves
during the early Years of Awakening.
Perhaps they’d finally learned enough about the galaxy
that surrounded them? Perhaps their societal progress had
finally propelled them into the greater universe? A more
ominous possibility, one favored by storytellers, is that the
Ghosts of Creuss have come forth for some sinister purpose
yet to be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As beings of energy and light, the Ghosts certainly can
be placed among the strangest of the known races. The
famous historian Merean Barqan described them as “ethereal
luxsynaptic souls.” As their forms do not remain stable outside
the strange gravity of the Creuss itself, the Ghosts garb
themselves in intricate metalwork. Not only does the armor
stabilize the Ghosts, but its tangible shape places members
of the other races more at ease in their presence. Individual
Creuss can be discerned from one another by the unique
design of their helmets, which, like their ships, are intricately
carved with runes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ghosts of Creuss have shown themselves to be perfectly
civilized, polite, and masters of many strange sciences and
materials. Yet, they’re also regarded as exceptionally secretive,
ritualistic, and prickly on a wide range of matters. It’s generally
undecided whether their behavior is one to be expected of a
race so recently introduced to the material galaxy, or whether
these are signs that something more ominous lurks beneath
their brooding metal helmets.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;h1&gt;Quantum Entanglement&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The effect of the &lt;i&gt;Enforced Travel Ban&lt;/i&gt; law does not affect the Creuss player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Creuss player has units or controls planets in a system with an alpha wormhole, and another player has units or controls planets in a system with a beta wormhole, or vice versa, then the Creuss player and that player are neighbors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mentak player may use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability against the Creuss player in this manner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If Mecatol Rex contains an alpha wormhole, then the &amp;ldquo;For&amp;rdquo; effect of the &lt;i&gt;Ixthian Artifact&lt;/i&gt; agenda will not affect the Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s units in a system with a beta wormhole (and no alpha wormhole), and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Quantum Entanglement&lt;/sc&gt; ability applies to their units with the &lt;sc&gt;Deep Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability. Other players cannot use &lt;sc&gt;Quantum Entanglement&lt;/sc&gt; to produce hits from a unit with the &lt;sc&gt;Deep Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability against the Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s units.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Slipstream&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;sc&gt;Slipstream&lt;/sc&gt; does not apply to the Creuss Gate or to the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt;, or to gamma wormholes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Creuss Gate&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A frontier token is placed in the Creuss Gate system during setup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Both the Creuss Gate and the Creuss home system (in standard game board setups) are on the edge of the board.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Creuss IFF &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may receive the &lt;i&gt;Creuss IFF&lt;/i&gt; in a transaction during their turn. If received at the start of that player&amp;rsquo;s turn, that player may play it immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive the &lt;i&gt;Creuss IFF&lt;/i&gt; more than once per turn.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the active player received the &lt;i&gt;Creuss IFF&lt;/i&gt; on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Creuss player to regain it. However, the &lt;i&gt;Creuss IFF&lt;/i&gt; cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play the &lt;i&gt;Creuss IFF&lt;/i&gt; again until their next turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any deal between the Creuss player and another player regarding where the wormhole tokens will be placed, if made before the &lt;i&gt;Creuss IFF&lt;/i&gt; is exchanged, is non&amp;ndash;binding.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Creuss IFF&lt;/i&gt; may be played even if the Creuss player has not researched &lt;i&gt;Wormhole Generator&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Creuss IFF&lt;/i&gt; cannot place wormhole tokens in the home system of an eliminated player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dimensional Splicer &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any wormhole may trigger &lt;i&gt;Dimensional Splicer&lt;/i&gt;, including the one produced by the ability of the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;One hit will be produced even if the system contains multiple wormholes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Creuss player chooses which ship the hit is assigned to.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Shields Holding&lt;/i&gt; action card may be used to cancel the hit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The chosen ship may cancel the hit by using its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability, if present. A different ship with the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability cannot do so.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the chosen ship does so, the &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Reflective Shielding&lt;/i&gt; action cards may be used.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wormhole Generator &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This ability is mandatory for the Creuss player in every status phase after it has been researched.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Creuss player may move a wormhole token from the system it is in into the same system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wormhole Generator&lt;/i&gt; cannot place wormhole tokens in the home system of an eliminated player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wormhole Generator &amp;Omega; &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Creuss player may move a wormhole token from the system it is in into the same system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wormhole Generator&lt;/i&gt; cannot place wormhole tokens in the home system of an eliminated player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hil Colish &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt; moves first, then the Creuss player uses the new position of the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt; when determining if the active system may be reached by their other ships.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt; moves last, then it may move itself into (or through, if its move value is increased) the Creuss Gate or Creuss home system. Before it does so, the Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s other ships may move through the wormhole created by the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The delta wormhole moves with the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt;; it cannot move back to its origin system using its own delta wormhole.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The Creuss player must declare all ships that will moving before they move the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt; or their other ships. They then declare the path that the first ship(s) to move will travel along, and move those ship(s). They then declare the path that the other ship(s) to move will travel along, and move those ships. Any ships that were declared to move must, if it is possible to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;ol&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt; is moved first, and is removed due to the effect of a gravity rift, other ships that were declared to move that can reach the destination system must do so, even if the path is through the gravity rift. Ships that cannot reach the active system do not move.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Creuss player cannot wait to see the result of their other ships&amp;rsquo; gravity rift rolls before deciding to move the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt;; they must declare if the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt; is moving at the same time they declare which other ships are moving.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt; moves before or after other ships, it does not generate a second &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A unit with the &lt;sc&gt;Deep Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability may produce hits in systems adjacent to that unit via the delta wormhole in the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo;s system. Most commonly, this will allow the Creuss player to target units in the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo;s system from the space cannon rolls of units in their home system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an effect allows another player to move through a system that contains the Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s ships (such as the &lt;i&gt;Light/Wave Deflector&lt;/i&gt; technology), that player may move through the delta wormhole in the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo;s system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During space combat involving the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt;, either player may retreat to another system containing a delta wormhole, if that system meets the other requirements for retreating.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt; is destroyed between the &lt;b&gt;Announce Retreats&lt;/b&gt; step and the &lt;b&gt;Retreat&lt;/b&gt; step, then the retreating player must retreat to a different eligible system. If no such system exists, then their retreat is cancelled.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt; retreats, it may retreat before or after the Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s other ships, but cannot retreat in such a way that would prevent the other ships from retreating to the same system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Emissary Taivra &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Creuss player may use this ability to access the inactive wormhole nexus without a gamma wormhole. Moving ships into the wormhole nexus this way will cause it to flip.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A delta wormhole in the system (such as from the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt;) does not prevent this ability from being usable.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If this ability is used, the active system will be adjacent to systems with delta wormholes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a ship moves from the system containing the Ion Storm, it will not flip, unless the active player may move ships through the Ion Storm wormhole and chooses to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The system must have a non&amp;ndash;delta wormhole in it at the moment of activation. If a wormhole is placed in a system with no other wormholes using the ability of an Icarus Drive, then Emissary Taivra cannot be used during the same activation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a wormhole is placed at the start of a player&amp;rsquo;s turn in the system using the Creuss IFF, then Emissary Taivra may be used for the activation immediately following.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Sai Seravus &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The fighters are placed one at a time, until either one has been placed for each ship with capacity that moved through a wormhole, or the capacity of the system is reached.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The Creuss player cannot remove a ground force to create capacity for a fighter.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The Creuss cannot place additional fighters once they have fighters and infantry in the space area equal to their capacity in that system, even if they have unused fleet pool and the fighter II unit upgrade technology.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Creuss player has a space dock in the active system, they may consider some of the fighters they place as held by the space dock, in order to continue placing fighters.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This ability may be used whenever the Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s ships move, not just during the movement step of a tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Creuss player retreats from a combat, then they will have no capacity in the active system, and so cannot place any fighters there.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player uses their &lt;i&gt;Benediction&lt;/i&gt; hero ability to move the Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s ships, then the Creuss player may use this ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ship may move out of a system and back into the same system during tactical action movement, if its move value is high enough. If the Creuss player does this with a ship with capacity, and moves in this manner via a wormhole, they may place a fighter, if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the Creuss player moves a ship through a wormhole, ending in a system that contains an alpha or beta wormhole and unlocks Sai Seravus, they cannot apply its ability to that movement.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Creuss player moves the &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt; separately from other ships during the same &lt;b&gt;Move Ships&lt;/b&gt; step, Sai Seravus cannot unlock until all movement is completed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Riftwalker Meian &amp;mdash; Singularity Reactor &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any units and tokens on either system are moved with their system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Icarus Drive &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Icarus Drive does not have to be in the activated system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The wormhole token is placed in the system the Icarus Drive was in.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;In the dimly lit corners of border space, where the tales of daring captains and intrepid explorers meet and whisper of the unknown, there is one tale that has begun to surface and spread like a ghostly echo—a story spoken in hushed tones within the taverns that serve as sanctuaries for weary travelers. It is the tale of a small exploratory fleet, venturing into the depths of the darkest voids of the galaxy, driven by the thirst for discovery and the longing for forgotten wonders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the fringes of uncharted space, this intrepid vessel sailed, guided by the siren’s call of a mysterious gravity signature. The crew, a collection of seasoned scouts and audacious adventurers, brimmed with anticipation as they weaved through the vast expanse; their hearts whispered of untold treasures, of a forgotten planet, or even an ancient relic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet as their ship ventured deeper into the abyss, what they encountered was far beyond their wildest imaginings—a colossal, otherworldly spectacle that defied comprehension. A sprawling school of gargantuan creatures, their forms ethereal and diverse, moved in a mesmerizing dance that clouded out the stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These behemoths, though not overtly hostile, exuded an air of enigmatic purpose. The explorers watched as several of their probes ventured too close, only to be swiftly engulfed, devoured without remorse. The tale of that fateful encounter is woven into the tapestry of frontier lore—a captain’s haunting recollection shared in whispers, a testament to the boundless wonders and terrors that dwell in the deepest darkness of space... The Ghoti All-Mother and Her school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the Ghoti are an offshoot of the Vuil’Raith horrors or simply another of the galaxy’s vast mysteries is unknown. Of no discernible origin, the schools of the Ghoti roam the empty spaces of the galaxy, feeding and growing as they swarm, leaving behind little more than legends and questions. What purpose could drive such vast creatures? Why have they begun to claim planets with troops and ships that seem to have evolved for battle and recent needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is speculation that a nest of horrors into the galaxy have pushed the Ghoti to defend their swimvoids and formerly abandoned corners of the galaxy. Alternatively, it might be the simple response of an animal cornered by expanding fleets and the loss of their natural habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, individuals have come forward claiming to represent the Ghoti, and they speak wisdom that might well come from the ancient beasts somehow. Plenty of galactic powers mutter that these are merely deluded fools and that their influence on the council is unearned, nothing more than a charlatan’s game. Darker whispers of monstrous cultists are unconfirmed but seem unlikely given the Ghoti’s mostly neutral demeanor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain, however: the empty voids between the stars are no longer safe for random travelers. The Ghoti’s call rings through space, in an elusive dance that sees the School appearing in wildly separated parts of the galaxy. Eyewitnesses corroborate the evidence of galactic powers’ deep scanners and exploratory probes: the Ghoti deep fleets know how to weave between the stars, traveling unimaginable distances as though they have somehow harnessed wormhole travel. Yet there is no evidence of this advanced technology among these unsophisticated creatures. Galactic powers are on high alert to secure their borders, while undercover agents negotiate with self-proclaimed Ghoti worshippers to squeeze out any information that might give them an edge.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;The GLEdge Mining Conglomerate was once a lawless system of nobodies on the edge of the galaxy. It was the backwoods of the galaxy on the fringe of what was charted and interstellar space; it had no official name—many simply referred to it as "The Edge." When an independent mining company survey reported that the Fringe system and its neighbors were mineral rich, the board decided it would be most cost-effective to simply hire the local inhabitants as contractors. It sent resources and tools to the Edge and trained its people in the way of deep core mining, and as a byproduct opened trade lines from the inner galaxy to the Edge. The mining company referred to them “GLEdge” contractors, short for “Galactic Limit Edge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the nexus on this trade-highway, this rush proved to be a huge economic boom for the Fringe system: better infrastructure was built system-wide, and living standards improved rapidly as the community worked towards a singular goal. After a century of uplifting the system, though, a minor galactic war resulted in dissolution of the parent mining company, with the longstanding corporate-funded trading lanes and communications systems going offline. This sudden isolation might have sent a less united system into a spiral of despair, but the locals took this sudden abandonment as an opportunity to become something more than corporate contractors: they had to become self-sustaining. The people voted to form the Gledge Mining Conglomerate, a mix between a corporate entity and a state. The Gledge constructed their first interstellar fleet of mining and logistical vessels and, when the galaxy finally began to recover, opened up their services to the rest of the galaxy. With their notoriety for being raised from dirt, their cheap rates, and hard labor, they quickly became one of the top mining contractors in the galaxy. Today, they remain the largest independent corporate entity not headquartered in Veldyr space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller systems with dubious ownership claims and planets without standing defenses are at the mercy of roaming Gledge Extraction Flotillas. Often, smart diplomacy, exorbitant bribes, or calling in military favors is required to save planets. Though the Gledge might call upon their own defensive perimeter fleets—ostensibly to protect the flotilla from piracy—to clear aside local objections to their industrial ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gledge motivation for stripping planets of their valuables is too often easily dismissed as greed—if the Union wished to maximize their wealth, they would more carefully sift their mineral hordes for fragments of antiquity and ancient technology. Instead, loudspeakers blare worker-miner propaganda songs as hazard-suited employees march along purposefully to their workstations. Gledge workers move with precision and efficiency, and despite the grueling nature of their work, they seem to truly enjoy their tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the galaxy becomes restless once more, Gledge mineral scouts are turn to more strategic targets. Large gravitic drills are repurposed to clearing enemy dreadnoughts. Hardened, heat-tempered hulls are angled to resist traditional starship weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gledge industry is a stellar ballet on cosmic shores: planets are vast, but the galaxy is vaster, and worlds are grains of sand to the Gledge. They will not hesitate to brush some of that sand from their heavily gloved hands if it gets in the way.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="TheGlimmerOfMortheus_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The Glimmer of Mortheus, by definition, are hard to pin down. All of those who have been able to study the Shimmering Veil, where they dwell, seem certain that there is more than one sentient entity within the shifting clouds of dust and energy, but the exact nature of these beings, let alone their number, is as-yet unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Veil has been known to the galaxy since the days of the Mahact, but only in recent times have the strange signals begun emanating from the nebula, and so only recently has it been thoroughly probed. Initial expeditions into the system by unmanned craft were complete failures, the craft simply vanishing without trace. Early crewed expeditions either suffered similar fates, or returned with crews gone mad, ships badly damaged, with those who could communicate telling tales of fighting against reflections of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally contact has been made with the entities within the Veil. They call themselves the Mortheus. All that has been learned of the Mortheus has come from cryptic, rare, and often difficult to decipher communication from the Mortheus themselves, or sparse data that can be gleaned from continued scans from outside the nebula. It is undisputed that there are at least two significant planetary bodies within the veil, the Mortheus confirm this data. They refer to these bodies in tandem, Biaheo and Empero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mortheus claim that their bodies are composed of substances from each of these planets—or that these planets themselves are also composed of these substances. These substances the Mortheus also export, in exceedingly small quantities, through uncrewed craft ejected from the nebula, and so their properties have been studied to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biaheo is a dull, opaque matter which seems to remain constantly in flux. Empero is a pink semi-gaseous substance which emits high levels of radioactive energy from an unknown mechanism. Even the galaxy’s greatest scientists have yet to unlock the secrets of these substances, with some leaked rumors claiming that they may not have originated in this universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mortheus who interact with outsiders refer to themselves as colors, though they claim that such are only weak distillations of concepts beyond the comprehension of those outside the Mortheus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;They will speak little of their history, and seem to not fully understand the concept of time. Few have the patience to piece together the scraps of Mortheus communication and attempt coherence, but those who have all relate inexplicable tales of a cataclysmic event, stars at wrong angles, and a "Spark" which gave the Mortheus being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after communication was established, the Vaden Banking Clans dispatched an expeditionary force to stake a controlling claim near the Veil. So the Galaxy was made aware of the Glimmer of Mortheus' formidable prowess in war. With fleets that seemed to materialize from the clouds of the nebula surrounding their home, and rapidly deploying weaponry which matched that used by their foes, the Mortheus easily dispatched the attempt to encroach on their territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Galaxy now waits to see whether the Mortheus will remain secluded in their clouded home, or if their tendency to echo that which they meet will reflect an image of conquest back across the stars.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="TheKolleccSociety_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The Kollecc Society hails from deep within Suros Space, and proudly proclaims their role throughout the galaxy as treasure hunters, bounty hunters, and relic dealers. And they do indeed maintain a vast collection of rare artifacts. However, their enigmatic and closely-guarded cloaking technology has made them notorious as "thieves" and “grave robbers." To the Kollecc, their technology is for protection, and just because they evaded a hostile planetary blockade with a few dusty pieces of a relic onboard doesn't mean that they were "smuggling" or "subverting galactic law and order". Even if those dusty relics turned out to be a critical piece of scientific gadgetry, it's not the Kollecc's fault Veldyr or other scientists later bid up the price against each other... The Kollecc are simply trying to make their way through the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the Kollecc’s affinity with archaeology and scientific rigor, it often surprises outsiders to see that other factions with exploratory traditions explicitly contrast themselves with the Kollecc Society. Where others would claim they approach relics from an academic and scientific perspective, The Kollecc have no hesitations or qualms identifying their approach is largely commercial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kollecc diplomats explain that this is just propaganda - that others get confused, aren't focused, and lack the professional touch. Meanwhile, an independent Kollecc explorer simply gathers, documents, cross-references, and puts a tag on their discoveries; a price tag, that is. Expeditions don't fund themselves, after all. The Kollecc generally view their fellow archaeologists as naive or idealistic business competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With recent unexpected Kortali raids on their reliquaries, the Kollecc Society has found secondary use for their defensive cloaking technology: ironically, sneaking into a blockaded system is sometimes easier than sneaking out of a blockaded system. The Kollecc are turning their commercial profits to war, ordering ships from the Shipwrights and retrofitting them for cloaking stealth operations. Relics that would otherwise go to auction are finding themselves on diplomatic gift lists for galactic councilors, or sometimes strapped into experimental rigs onboard terrifying dreadnoughts. Yssaril spies, themselves invisible inside Kollecc outposts, find the tables turned back on themselves as small squads of Kollecc decloak to apprehend them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The galaxy is rapidly discovering that the same skills that make for good “robbers” and “smugglers” can be used to infiltrate and strike precision enemy targets. As these operations ramp up across the galaxy in both frequency and intensity, rumors abound that the Kollecc are preparing a seat for themselves on Mecatol’s throne, and to use that position to plunder its ancient vaults for further powerful artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  </data>
  <data name="TheKortaliTribunal_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The Kortali are a fanatical and militaristic faction, ruled by a council of judges known as the Tribunes. The Kortali's society is governed by a rigid hierarchy of judicial officers and arbiters, all of whom adhere to the teachings of the three Kortali Queens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first queen represents the Kortali virtues of honor, glory, and death. She is revered as the goddess of war, inspiring Kortali warriors to fight bravely and die honorably in battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second queen represents the aspects of life, blood, and darkness. She is believed to have the power to grant new life to the Kortali, transforming them into powerful knights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third queen represents the aspects of spirits, law, and judgment. She is believed to preside over all Kortali law, guiding justice and overseeing the administration of the Krtirarchy in its entirety, both in this life and the beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these three queens form the divine rulership of the Kortali, governing every aspect of their society through a rigidly structured hierarchy of judicial officers and arbiters. Some outsiders mutter that it's convenient how the Queens' directives are only ever passed down to their people through the Tribune, but deep surveillance and leaked information shows it is highly unlikely that the Queens are invented whole, or if they are, even the Tribunes don’t believe so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kortali devotion to their Queens is absolute, and they view death as a mercy to be delivered in the Queens' names. The Kortali Knights, their warrior class, are known for their characteristic lack of self-preservation, believing that death in battle will grant them deliverance from mortality into paradise or the honor of being born again as a Jurat. As they conquer in the names of their Queens, the Kortali strike hard and fast, pushing their ships to gain advantage, themselves wholly to the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kortali's unrelenting dedication and military tendencies make them a feared and dangerous force. In the galactic senate, the Kortali system is a mix of fear and suspicion, and their impatience for their own wellbeing makes them overly brash and dangerous. By abrogating their own decision for the jurats’ wishes, Kortali don’t mind how they are seen, only responsible for their actions, justifying nearly every action in service to the Queens' directives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the Kortali have been adapting their strategies to operate with more nuance. Rather than simply seeking conquest, they have been expanding their technological and imperial interests, and instead of a wide-ranging field of war they now deliberately advance fronts with targeted strikes. Analysis indicates these more recent efforts appear focused on gathering relics and fragments to bring back to their core systems. While they are still viewed with suspicion by many on the galactic council, their recent willingness to explore other avenues of expansion and trade has given them a newfound respect among some of their old rivals. Nonetheless, their unrelenting and militant tendencies maintain their reputation as a feared and dangerous force in the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, outside powers have been digging deeper into the Kortali systems to try to find cracks in their fanaticism. Yssaril spies and Kollec operatives in particular are intrigued by the sudden interest in relics. Among whispered heresies linking the Queens to the Mahact, or an even older power, Kortali faith remains challenged but unbroken.&lt;p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Among the Zealots of Rhodun, Hierophant Kah was one of the most steadfast of that organization’s religious leaders, entrusted with keys to reliquaries containing vast arrays of restricted and ritually protected ancient relics on the planet of Poh. One of those relics was known as the Kyro, an ancient artifact inscribed with secret texts, and Hierophant Kah was the officiant of the elaborate annual ritual that verified its integrity and continued operations. The Zealots refuse to discuss or speculate on what led Kah to abdicate his duties, but there are rumors that his library studies and deep understanding of the Kyro ritual brought him to believe that it had the power to control demons. Others claim that instead some advanced protective mechanism of the relic slowly wormed itself into his dreams; that by reading and understanding its surface text something grew in his mind that led him to sabotage the ritual of containment which held the profane secrets of the relic at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As vast ancient powers began to appear on the galactic stage, Kah’s belief in the power of the relic’s ability to control ancient demons overtook his years of training: the time had come to use the artifacts the Zealots had locked away to strike out and defend themselves. Instead of returning the Kyro to its holding place in the temple, Kah took it upon himself to unlock the relic in his private quarters. What the device revealed to him is uncertain, but in a short time he had gathered a small group of Rhodlun heretics around him to worship its power. They came to be known as the Kyro Sodality, and when his fellow Zealots discovered his betrayal, the Sodality made a desperate break from the Ord system. Although the Zealots pursued the group ruthlessly, and destroyed most of their ships, it is believed Kah survived with the relic and sufficient followers to establish a safe protective enclave in the Avicenna system, now known as “Rothold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, individuals with scientific enquiries, in biomedical research, and dubious morals have been seen shuttling between the larger galactic powers and Kyro Sodality outposts. The Zealots seem to be biding their time, as if monitoring the growing regional power. Small groups of Sodality supporters are appearing in otherwise neutral systems, either as instigators or local power players; the mechanism for this steady infiltration is not yet known.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intercepted communications between interested parties seem to confirm that something is happening in Avicenna... Images of sick individuals, at wildly varying stages of what seems to be physical transformation, suggest that some kind of plague outbreak has recently occurred, although its source is unknown. What seems to be a strange variant of greyfire mutagen affects some of the Sodality diplomats, and Brotherhood scientists have been spotted on Sodality planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kyro Sodality’s goals remain inscrutable, but it is clear that their influence is slowly but steadily spreading, and that some of their members are strange, twisted versions of their former selves. Perhaps the Kyro relic is indeed controlling demons, just those of its own making.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;It has been 13 years since the Hacan trader Zollar was lost,
its final desperate broadcast intercepted by a Yssaril outpost
near the Mahact asteroid fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last transmission of the Zollar told a grim story. After
leaving Moll Primus in the Mahact region, its navigation
equipment failed, and its crew found themselves lost far
beyond the remote borderlands. After nearly two weeks adrift
in deep space, they were suddenly hailed by a great warship
of unknown origin. The crew’s joy soon turned to terror. The
warship closed, bringing its broadside cannons to bear on the
helpless freighter. The Hacan captain was able to send a final
emergency broadcast before his ship was destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after the disappearance of the Zollar, a mighty alien
fleet appears on the outskirts of Yssaril space. From that fleet, a
small delegation of representatives travels to Mecatol, submitting
an ancestral claim to the Imperial Throne. They claim to be the
true remnants of the ancient Lazax, now calling themselves the
L1Z1X (“Ell Won Zee Won Ex”). Grisly to behold, they resemble
the Lazax, but utterly changed, their bodies almost entirely
overtaken by invasive cybernetic implants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Winnaran custodians are deeply divided over the issue.
Some claim that the L1Z1X are not the ruling race, but a new
and potentially dangerous hybrid. Other Winnarans argue that
the Lazax have returned, in unexpected form, but returned
nonetheless, and that their custodianship is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Winnaran observer has been allowed to visit the L1Z1X
home world, called “0.0.0” by its inhabitants, or “Null” by most
others. The observer has not yet returned, and the L1Z1X
remain a largely unknown entity. What little is known of them
has been provided by the L1Z1X themselves, or obtained from
a few old records provided by the Jol-Nar Regents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Hylar records and from the L1Z1X claim, it has
been inferred that the L1Z1X history started during the final
days of the Lazax. It was less than a year before the great bombing
of Mecatol that a councilor to the Emperor by the name of Ibna
Vel Syd saw the impending doom. The Emperor and his other
councilors refused to listen to Ibna’s dire warnings. Soon Ibna
grew frustrated with their myopia. Although the Lazax navy was
clearly failing, although droves of systems were daily joining
the three rebellions, although trade had entirely failed, and
food supplies on Mecatol were running out, the Emperor and
his cabinet simply could not comprehend that their birthright,
their empire, could possibly fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refusing to share the fate of his liege, Ibna Vel Syd began
secretly planning a furtive diaspora for his own family and
the few thousand Lazax who shared his fears. With him, Ibna
sought to bring the pillars of Lazax culture, technology, and
knowledge. He even managed to persuade a small group of
Hylar scientists to join him, recognizing that the Hylar’s skill
was instrumental to the underlying technology of the empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on a fateful night
during the seventy-second
year of the Twilight Wars, two
freighters, the Manda and the
Hurwana, and Ibna’s own cruiser, Syd,
left the great spaceport of Mecatol City.
Below them, the great Hall of Cartography burned. So fearful
had Ibna been of discovery and persecution by the Lazax’s
enemies that he had engineered the destruction of any record
that could possible identify his secret destination: a cold but
adequate planet orbiting the small star Hazz, far beyond the
borderlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is guessed that the colony, struggling to survive, started
to rely almost exclusively on technology to assist them in
their hardships. Presumably helped by the small contingent of
Hylar, technology crept into their lives and bodies, until they
became almost indistinguishable from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is rumored that Ibna Vel Syd still leads his people,
encased in eldritch technology that keeps his ancient body
alive. Whether the L1Z1X are guided by the wisdom that
saved them or by the insanity that destroyed the famed Hall
of Cartography, it is not known. Behind their vacant red eyes
lie both a tragic history and a terrible malevolence. It seems
certain that the return of the Lazax will wash across the galaxy
like a tide of prophecy and steel.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    &lt;li&gt;If the L1Z1X player would have to place a structure, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a structure of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The L1Z1X player must mandatorily replace every structure. However, if there are none of that type in their reinforcements they are not forced to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Harrow&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;sc&gt;Planetary Shield&lt;/sc&gt; ability will prevent the use of the &lt;sc&gt;Harrow&lt;/sc&gt; ability on a planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The L1Z1X player cannot use their &lt;sc&gt;Harrow&lt;/sc&gt; ability if they are not the active player. This will most commonly occur due to the effect of the N&amp;rsquo;orr player&amp;rsquo;s commander, G&amp;rsquo;hom Sek&amp;rsquo;kus.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The L1Z1X player may use their &lt;sc&gt;Harrow&lt;/sc&gt; ability at the end of the round in which their last ground force was destroyed. This may cause the combat to end in a draw.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the &lt;b&gt;Bombardment&lt;/b&gt; step, each of the L1Z1X player&amp;rsquo;s units with the &lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt; ability is assigned only one planet to bombard. However, during ground combat, every unit in the system with the &lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt; ability may use it against the planet the ground combat is taking place on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An Annihilator may bombard when using &lt;sc&gt;Harrow&lt;/sc&gt; if that mech is not currently participating in ground combat, even if it has been committed to a different planet, and has been or will be involved in another ground combat during the current invasion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The L1Z1X player may use the ability of the X&amp;ndash;89 Bacterial Weapon &amp;Omega; technology card whenever they bombard.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Cybernetic Enhancements &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the L1Z1X player has no command tokens in their strategy pool, &lt;i&gt;Cybernetic Enhancements&lt;/i&gt; cannot be played.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Cybernetic Enhancements &amp;Omega; &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Inheritance Systems &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The two resources for &lt;i&gt;Inheritance&lt;/i&gt; Systems must be paid in addition to and separately from any other costs paid to research the technology. For example, if the L1Z1X player is performing the secondary of the &lt;i&gt;Technology&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, they cannot spend the five resources of [0.0.0] plus one trade good to pay for the costs of both &lt;i&gt;Technology&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Inheritance Systems&lt;/i&gt;. Instead, they would have to spend [0.0.0] to pay for the cost of &lt;i&gt;Technology&lt;/i&gt;, wasting the fifth resource, then spend two trade goods to pay for the cost of &lt;i&gt;Inheritance Systems&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Super Dreadnought &lt;sub&gt;(Unit)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;I48S &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The infantry must be in the system when it is activated for it to be eligible to be replaced. It cannot be replaced if it is moved into or produced in the active system later in the turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player wishes to place a mech, but there are none left in their reinforcements, they may remove a mech from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead. The mech will be placed undamaged.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Helmsman &amp;mdash; Dark Space Navigation &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ships in systems with one of the L1Z1X player&amp;rsquo;s command tokens may move.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ships may transport units only if their origin system does not contain one of the L1Z1X player&amp;rsquo;s command tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A future rule change will allow a player&amp;rsquo;s ships to transport units from systems that contain that player&amp;rsquo;s command token when those ships move outside of a tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ships move directly to their destination system. They may only transport units from their origin system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ships moving out of a gravity rift must roll for removal.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ships cannot move into a nebula or supernova, even if it contains one of the L1Z1X player&amp;rsquo;s command tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ships may travel into an asteroid field only if the L1Z1X player owns the &lt;i&gt;Antimass Deflectors&lt;/i&gt; technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dark Space Navigation&lt;/i&gt; may be used to move ships into the wormhole nexus. If the nexus is inactive, this will cause it to activate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Annihilator &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An Annihilator may bombard when using the L1Z1X player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Harrow&lt;/sc&gt; ability if that mech is not currently participating in ground combat, even if it has been committed to a different planet, and has been or will be involved in another ground combat during the current invasion.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An Annihilator may bombard any one planet during the &lt;b&gt;Bombardment&lt;/b&gt; step of an invasion.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;The Lanefir refer to Aysis' Rest as their homeworld, but strictly speaking it is the homeworld of the Lanefir Remnants culture, not the true Lanefir origin world. The Lanefir peoples evolved on the planet now known as Solitude, and millennia ago only a few small exploratory teams had begun prospecting its lush twin planet Grakhal. Generally a friendly, garrulous people, the Lanefir had started to send diplomatic teams to familiarize themselves with the many galactic civilizations and empires around them, too. During this expansionist growth period of their civilization, an archaeological team on Grakhal had entered a deep cavern system and found a dark artifact, said to originate from a long-past Empire. It was transported back to Solitude and presented in the Grand Library for a formal scientific examination, to be broadcast to the Lanefir people and their neighboring galactic powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relic released a high energy pulse, and the now-notorious blast scorched the surface of Solitude, annihilating its entire Lanefir population. On Grakhal, Aysis Kralloc, leader of the exploratory expedition, could only look up at the silhouette of her home planet. Had the artifact been activated only a few hours earlier or later, the Lanefir peoples would have been entirely eradicated before the galaxy had ever had the opportunity to learn of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Lanefir survivors on Grakhal gathered under Aysis's command, they struggled for decades to survive and reform a stable society from the remnants of their population. When Aysis died peacefully, having achieved a monumental success in keeping her people alive, the society collectively agreed to rename Grakhal to Aysis' Rest, and began to refer to themselves officially as the Lanefir Remnants. Even now, thousands of years later, the Remnants have never forgotten the loss of their kin on the graveyard world that hangs in their sky, a permanent reminder of their folly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering in the rebuilt Forbidden Library on Solitude, the wisest of the Lanefir have been quietly watching the slow cycles of galactic rise and decline for millennia. In their Forbidden Library, many collected tomes tell of the horrors of war and predation that lie ahead. On Aysis' Rest, their ruling council—known as the Conclave—has decided that for the good of all civilizations in the galaxy it is time for this cycle of destruction to end once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conclave has reorganized the Lanefir military into highly trained strike teams that specialize in securing archaeological digs and intercepting planetary exploration teams. Any dangerous technology they find is confiscated and returned to military command. Even on their own planets, these archaeo-strike teams continue to raid surface dig sites and abscond with any ancient debris they find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Lanefir diplomats inevitably provide physical proof of these artifacts' destruction, there is significant criticism of the Lanefir Remnant's approach. Galactic intelligence consensus seems to be that, despite their claims, Lanefir technology has advanced more rapidly in recent times. Lanefir high command has repeatedly explained that this is purely a result of enhanced research funding during times of war, but numerous reports intercepted from various other factions dispute this explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the truth, it is inevitable that if the Lanefir gain the throne, they will strip the ancient imperial reliquary halls of their artifacts and stack them high on pyres. Behind the flames, and under the watchful eyes of the Lanefir, the galaxy will be forever free from the shackles of the past.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

&lt;p&gt;After you perform a tactical action in a system, you may attach 1 “Trap” card from your reinforcements to a planet in that system that contains 1 or more of your infantry units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SUBTERFUGE:&lt;/p&gt;

    <value>Have 3 trap attachments on the game board.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="TheLiZhoDynasty_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The Li-Zho are a deeply intellectual reptilian people with extensive intrapersonal, intrafamilial, and intrasectarian networks. Li-Zho pride themselves on extracting influence and power through intricate manipulation of laws, customs and social expectations, and to this end they have crafted an extensive bureaucratic societal system—led by a widely admired and powerful Empress—to maintain their hypercompetitive but ultra-pacifistic civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Li-Zho live under a complex web of plots, politicking, and social tests. A generous gift of a landscape painting to a rival, the night sky depicted as it was at the exact date and time of some humiliating defeat. A misplaced comma sneaking its way into law by all-too-apparent accident, shifting key authority and responsibilities away from a long-time challenger. A carefully-planned string of delays to make an upstart unacceptably late to their own committee. These are all part of the game, and they never tire of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No overt anger flares in Li-Zho; true defeat lies in angrily acknowledging one has been destroyed by a technicality; true honor lies in appreciating the intricate effort one’s enemy has committed to a meticulous, premeditated, and excellently-executed assault upon one’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This adherence to cultural and societal combat plays very differently on the field of interstellar battle, with foes whose intellect for tactical snares has not been honed over countless millennia. Li-Zho pacifism is primarily turned toward their own people, out of a certain respect for their rivals, the game itself, and the authority of the Empress. Outsiders who engage would do well not to lose this competitive respect, and shield from grievous physical harm. After all, what sort of fool would get caught in a practically pedestrian surprise attack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent times, fleets of sleek Li-Zho bombers have strafed planetary surfaces without warning, and battles planetside have brought decisive victories only explainable by covert access to enemy strategic briefings. A Li-Zho general might spend a week laying a minefield in clear sight, before sending a poorly encrypted message to their command that the minefield is a decoy. Then opposing counterintelligence proudly relays the intercepted message to their infantry, and the division is summarily vaporized in the minefield, the Li-Zho can only dismay at this profound lack of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Dynasty begins to rise as a powerbroker in the galactic political sphere, they are bending their skills for feints-within-feints toward exploitation of design flaws, logistical disruptions, and disinformation. Wherever rumors might be found, one can guess the Li-Zho were the first to know. Indeed, there are growing concerns that they have managed to infiltrate even the most sophisticated intelligence services across the galaxy, who have found themselves scrambling to adapt to this new era of information warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategic prowess and shrewd diplomacy have earned the Li-Zho a reputation as brilliant tacticians. Each Li-Zho yearns to establish a network of connections and social debts that will raise them above their rivals, demonstrating their worth to the Empress and the rest of the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Li-Zho’s path to the imperial throne is subtle, and their purpose is uncertain, but there is no question that establishing themselves at the height of galactic power will provide them the ultimate opportunity to control the deep, interwoven machinations that they love best.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="TheLTokkKhrask_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;A primordial race of crystalline entities, the L’Tokk Khrask have witnessed eons of galactic history. It was not until very recently that the L’Tokk Khrask were even known to have a homeworld, much less an organized society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their homeworld, Bohl-Duhr, orbits a far-flung star on the outer rim of the galaxy, and is by all accounts an ancient, paradisiacal world covered in towering forests, rushing rivers, and sprawling meadows. It is a place of great natural beauty, as well as a source of inspiration and wonder for its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little is known about the creation of new L’Tokk Khrask, but based on limited conversations with their people, it seems their crystalline cores are animated through a process they call the “Stone Song,” a form of rhythmic rituals that allow an elder to share their experiences and animating energy with newly-formed L’Tokk Khrask. It is through this ritual that new L’Tokk Khrask are able to grasp the world around them, begin to gather their outer protective shells, and first experience life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The L’Tokk Khrask seemingly possess some limited form of shared-consciousness they describe as “harmony.” This network allows the L’Tokk Khrask to reach into the collective wisdom and experiences of their people and make decisions that are in the best interests of their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the Titans of Ul, which some have argued are a distant relative brought about by Mahact gene-sorcery, L'Tokk Khrask never truly cease growing. As one visits new worlds, and makes new memories, they slowly add to their outer shell. While a youthful L'Tokk Khrask might present with an outer shell built up from the matter of one world, the eldest of their people carry pieces of countless worlds with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The L'Tokk Khrask are governed by a highly egalitarian system known as the Elder Conclave. Every L'Tokk Khrask, regardless of age or status, has equal opportunity to speak before the Conclave, but great deference is given to the eldest members, who lead their people. The L'Tokk Khrask way of life is centered around the concepts of balance and harmony. Seeing themselves as guardians of nature, they are guided by a deep reverence for all life. They believe that everything in the universe is interconnected, and that the actions of one being can have a profound impact on the rest of the galaxy. Accordingly, they are deeply committed to living in harmony with the natural world around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the L'Tokk Khrask are collectivists, believing that the greater good is more important than individual success or status. They have no concept of personal ownership or property, and they share what they have with their community. They deeply believe that experiences are the truest measure of success, and so the most respected of their kind are those who have the most and best stories to tell. As a result, they are generally avid travelers and explorers. Most L'Tokk Khrask eagerly seek out adventure and knowledge wherever they can find it, in hopes that they might be able to bring back experiences and knowledge to share with their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their quiet demeanor and peaceful way of life, the Khrask are not entirely isolated from the ambitions and chaos that plague the rest of the galaxy. They believe that the balance of the universe is threatened by recent events, and that they have a duty to bring balance and harmony to the galaxy. The particularly unruly and over-ambitious of their foes may soon find that of the many cherished stories passed down from across the L'Tokk Khrask's unfathomably long history, not all are peaceful.&lt;/p</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Gene-sorcerers. Mad tyrants. Kings. The Mahact are a primal tale from ancient history. In the distant past, the Mahact dynasties terrorized the galaxy with their infighting and genesorcery. They could warp the forms of living beings, compel eternal obedience with a gesture, and turn the biospheres of entire worlds into seething, caustic hells. They unleashed their most vile technologies in war or even in debauched sport, and it seemed, even as their houses crumbled, that their fall might bring down all of civilized space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the midst of their orgy of self-destruction, a new Empire rose to challenge them. The Lazax, a young and fiery race, led the effort to destroy the Mahact and restore peace. When the last Mahact King was slain, the Lazax claimed the fruits of their victory, establishing just dominion over the ashes of the Mahact’s kingdoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the truth was somewhat more complicated than the Lazax wished anyone to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Empire did overthrow the Mahact Kings, slaying many of them and claiming the Mahact’s main fortress of Mecatol as their own. However, the Mahact were too powerful to defeat utterly. The last of them retreated from Mecatol, sowing anarchy and chaos in their wake, and leaving agents and sleepers to do their bidding. They fled the galaxy to their original home, the planet of Ixth. This world lay far beyond the furthest wisps of dust on the galactic arms, unreachable except through the great wormhole gate of Acheron. Here, in their ancient fastness, the remaining Mahact plotted their eventual return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lazax pursued their foes to the entrance of the gate on Acheron, but every attempt they made to invade Ixth failed. So the young Empire tried a different plan. They studied the gate’s arcane workings, and though they could not destroy it, they could shut it down. Thus, Lazax engineers deactivated the gate and buried its machinery beneath an entire ocean to guarantee that none would ever discover it again. They even purged all nearby worlds of life, turning surrounding space into a wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without control of the machinery on Acheron, the Mahact could not reopen their gate, or even rip it free and set its endpoint somewhere else in the galaxy. They were trapped on their dying world, overlooking a galaxy that was steadily forgetting their existence. Eventually, the remaining Mahact entered the stasis crypts beneath their dead city, to sleep until the stars burned out around them. And there they remained, until the Creuss expedition discovered the Acheron gate, opened it, and awoke them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an instant, the first Mahact saw the Creuss explorers and used arcane techno-rituals to dominate them and summon their ships through the Acheron Gate. Then, having no desire to remain prisoners on Ixth, the Mahact used the gate machinery to rip Ixth free from its star and hurl it into the heart of the galaxy. Never again would they be trapped on their homeworld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Ixth sails untethered through the galactic core, and the Mahact survey their former domain. Though there are only a handful of them left, each has the power of eons of technosorcery at their fingertips. The remaining Mahact turn to their own holdings, awakening their Ixthian bio-factories and assemblers, and summoning their dormant agents and their genetic descendants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corridors and halls of Ixth’s great city-machines fill with the gene-sorcerers’ thrall clones. Immense dreadnoughts have begun to rise from the underground assembler halls to hang in orbit over the planet. Legions of genecrafted warriors assemble in the mustering squares, ready to march to war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Mahact began to marshal their forces, a single golden ship appeared in orbit over Mecatol Rex. It descended to the Senate Possessional in the heart of Mecatol City, touching down on the perfectly manicured trille grass lawn. The hatches opened, and four emissaries stepped out. Each was one of the observers the Council had dispatched to the Creuss expedition to Ixth, reported lost by the few survivors who escaped. Now they wore robes of gold and steel, and were flanked by hulking Creuss legionaries, whose armor seethed with an ominous crimson glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They walked into the chambers of the Galactic Senate without fanfare or invitation and stood in the middle of the hall. Before the stunned audience, they announced that they were the emissaries of Vertar Auran Oblis, first amongst the galaxy’s rightful race of rulers. They went on to say that, as Oblis was a magnanimous ruler, all those who surrendered immediately would be favored slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emissaries returned to their ship and left the city behind. However, many fear that it is only a matter of time before a golden armada returns to the sky above Mecatol Rex. And when it does, the Mahact will return the world to the center of their kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;h1&gt;Edict&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player is ever required to remove one of their command tokens from their fleet pool, and they only have other players&amp;rsquo; command tokens in their fleet pool, they must remove one of those tokens, and return it to the reinforcements of the player that owns it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player is ever limited by the number of tokens they may have in their fleet pool, such as by the &lt;i&gt;Fleet Regulations&lt;/i&gt; law, they may still add a command token to their fleet pool when they are at the limit, but must then remove one command token and return it to the corresponding reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player wins a combat against a player that has no command tokens in their reinforcements, and none of their command tokens are on the Mahact player&amp;rsquo;s command sheet, that player must choose one of their command tokens on their command sheet to remove and place on the Mahact player&amp;rsquo;s command sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a player has no command tokens in their reinforcements or on their command sheet, the Mahact player cannot place one of that player&amp;rsquo;s command tokens on their command sheet if they win a combat against that player.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player is required to place a command token from their reinforcements on the board, such as when they retreat from a space combat, or the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, if they have no tokens in their reinforcements, they must use a Mahact token from any pool of their command sheet, and not another player&amp;rsquo;s token in their fleet pool.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the Mahact player wins a space combat, they add the command token to their fleet pool before they resolve fleet pool requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hubris&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a game effect would force another player to give a promissory note to the Mahact player, but the only promissory note that player has is their &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, that player does not give anything to the Mahact player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Scepter of Dominion &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player already has a command token in the chosen system, they do not place a command token there.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player has no command tokens in their reinforcements, that player places one command token of their choice from their command sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There is no mechanism to create a binding deal between the Mahact player and another player regarding which system that player will choose when resolving &lt;i&gt;Scepter of Domination&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mahact player will also place a command token in the chosen system, unless their command sheet has none of their own tokens on it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scepter of Dominion&lt;/i&gt; cannot place command tokens in the home system of an eliminated player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Genetic Recombination &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player that cannot vote due to a game effect or because they have zero influence on readied planets cannot be targeted by &lt;i&gt;Genetic Recombination&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a player then gains the ability to vote, such as by gaining the Xxcha player&amp;rsquo; &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, they may then be targeted by &lt;i&gt;Genetic Recombination&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Crimson Legionnaire &lt;sub&gt;(Unit)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If multiple Crimson Legionnaires are destroyed at the same time, the Mahact player decides whether to gain a commodity or convert a commodity to a trade good individually for each.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If two Crimson Legionnaires are destroyed at the same time, the Mahact player may choose to gain a commodity, then immediately convert that commodity to a trade good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Jae Mir Kan &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When resolving the secondary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Construction&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, the active player&amp;rsquo;s command token is placed in the system the Mahact player places their structure.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player chooses to resolve the secondary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Construction&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, they must choose a system in which they can place a structure.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player already has a command token in the chosen system, they place one of the active player&amp;rsquo;s command tokens in that system regardless.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player has the Muaat player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, they will not gain a trade good from it when they use the ability of Jae Mir Kan.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player activates a system containing another player&amp;rsquo;s units, they must still return any promissory notes with such an activation as the return condition.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mahact player may still use any &amp;ldquo;at the end of your turn&amp;rdquo; abilities.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Fighters and ground forces in the space area of the origin system are moved. Ground forces on planets are left behind.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player moves their own ships, they may transport ground forces on planets.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player moves the Saar player&amp;rsquo;s units, any Floating Factories in the origin system will also be moved.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any abilities that trigger when a player moves ships trigger from the perspective of the Mahact player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any abilities that trigger when a player&amp;rsquo;s ships move trigger from the perspective of the player that owns them.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any abilities that trigger when a player moves their ships do not trigger.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mahact player may move another player&amp;rsquo;s ships into an asteroid field only if that player owns the &lt;i&gt;Antimass Deflectors&lt;/i&gt; technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mahact player may move another player&amp;rsquo;s ships into a supernova only if that player owns the &lt;i&gt;Magmus Reactor&lt;/i&gt; Muaat factional technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;!--li&gt;The Mahact player may only move the Empyrean player&amp;rsquo;s ships into a nebula.&lt;/li--&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player moves a player&amp;rsquo;s ships out of a gravity rift, that player must roll for removal.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player is moving the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player&amp;rsquo;s ships out of a system containing a Dimensional Tear, the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player will not roll for removal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mahact player cannot move ships through a wormhole while the &lt;i&gt;Enforced Travel Ban&lt;/i&gt; law is in play.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mahact player cannot move the Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s ships from a system with an alpha wormhole into a system with a beta wormhole (and no alpha wormhole), or vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player moves the Muaat player&amp;rsquo;s war sun, the Muaat player cannot trigger their &lt;i&gt;Nova Seed&lt;/i&gt; hero ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The system the combat is taking place in is considered the active system during that combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The player whose ships were moved is considered to be the attacker, the other player is considered to be the defender.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Regardless of which of the two players in combat is the attacker and which is the defender, the next player in initiative order will resolve abilities first, after the Mahact player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Resolving &lt;i&gt;Benediction&lt;/i&gt; is not a tactical action. The &lt;b&gt;Activation&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Movement&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Invasion&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Production&lt;/b&gt; steps are not resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Any abilities that occur &amp;ldquo;when/after you/another player activate a system&amp;rdquo; will not trigger.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; substep is not resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Starlancer &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once the Mahact player resolves the ability of a Starlancer, the active player cannot use any &amp;ldquo;after you activate a system&amp;rdquo; abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other players, including the Mahact player, cannot use any &amp;ldquo;after another player activates a system that&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; abilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The active player may still use any &amp;ldquo;at the end of your turn&amp;rdquo; abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mahact player may use the ability to end their own turn and gain their own spent command token from their fleet pool.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Starlancer must be in the system before activation to be able to use its ability.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Mahact Plateau, part of the borderlands
and the old star route known as the Passage of Tears,
lies distant Moll Primus with its three tiny moons. The
young planet is predominantly covered by extensive
plains of the orange meet grass and sprinkled with a
million lakes. Sharp youthful mountains pierce the heart
of many of its continents, their icy mountain streams
giving life to steep lush mountain valleys, where green
fruitful trees and flowers grow in colorful contrast to the
orange plains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although rich for exploitation, the remoteness of
Moll Primus allowed the planet to go without organized
colonization by the Lazax for thousands of years after
its discovery. After the failed Gandar rebellion, however,
the Lazax started to use the planet as a penal colony,
a distant prison, for the worst offending political
dissidents and other criminals from all races. Exile to
Moll Primus meant a long journey in the bowels of a
prison freighter along the Passage of Tears, a winding
dark journey around the treacherous gravity wells of the
Mahact Plateau. Only the remote planet Hope’s End lies
farther than Moll Primus on the Passage of Tears. Once
on Moll Primus, prisoners were assigned to manual
labor under the supervision of one of the regional
planetary Governors. The Governors of Moll Primus
mostly consisted of Lazax politicians or servicemen
fallen into disgrace. An assignment to Moll Primus was
as much a sentence to a Lazax public career as it was a
prison for its population. Thus, the Governors were often
incompetent, cruel, and bitter individuals. Although the
planet itself was quite pleasant, even considered beautiful,
its prisoner population was tortured, malnourished, and
forced to fight in small-scale wars against the population
of neighboring Governors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, after more than 800 years, the Twilight Wars
began. As the empire crumbled, as the supply ships
and supervision from Mecatol Rex became infrequent
and finally failed, the Governors panicked. Some fled
the planet overnight with their entire households.
Others perished in the inevitable prisoner revolts that
followed. Before the Twilight Wars had subsided, Moll
Primus was free. Some of its most recent prisoners soon
left, but for most of its mixed-race population, Moll
Primus was home. After the united rebellion against the
Governor wardens, a brief period of infighting among
the different regions followed.
A single human, Erwan Mentak,
soon brought the regions together
in a final peace and, before he died,
prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Moll Primus is governed by the Table of
Captains, elected leaders from each region. Among
them a single leader is chosen every ten cycles and
granted the honorary title Erwan’s Hand or “the Hand”
for short. Helped by their Hylar brothers, the coalition
has made great progress in advancing their technological
status. Metals mined from Moll Primus’s moons, various
products made from the rich meet grass, income from
“special” fleet excursions, and the hard work of its
population have slowly formed the strong economic
backbone of a proud civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although publicly denied by Mentak ambassadors,
the Mentak employ a vast pirating fleet which wreaks
havoc among merchant shipping lanes and smaller
military convoys. Although now an educated culture
and civilization in their own right, the Mentak people
have never forgotten their roots as rogues and usurpers.
Every Mentak feels a historical need for revenge:
revenge against a galaxy that shipped their ancestors to
torture and rot on Moll Primus centuries ago. The Table
of Captains has given their Hand a clear mandate: to
scheme, pillage, and conquer until the ruled are rulers
and the enslaved are emperors.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect dice rolls made when resolving the &lt;sc&gt;Ambush&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a cruiser or destroyer is removed before the Mentak player can resolve their &lt;sc&gt;Ambush&lt;/sc&gt; ability, that ship cannot be one of the ships used when they do resolve their &lt;sc&gt;Ambush&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Shields Holding&lt;/i&gt; action card may be used to cancel the hit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ship may cancel the hit by using its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability, if present.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the chosen ship does so, the &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Reflective Shielding&lt;/i&gt; action cards may be played.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Pillage&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;While the agenda phase and the Hacan player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Trade Convoys&lt;/i&gt; promissory note allow a player to resolve transactions with all other players, they do not make that player neighbors with the Mentak player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Effects that force players to give objects to other players are not transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If Alice plays Bob&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Trade Agreement&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, then the Mentak player may use &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; on Alice, but not Bob.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Creuss player has units or controls planets in a system with an alpha wormhole, and the Mentak player has units or controls planets in a system with a beta wormhole, or vice versa, then the Creuss player and Mentak player are neighbors. The Mentak player may thus use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability against the Creuss player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Winnu player owns &lt;i&gt;Lazax Gate Folding&lt;/i&gt;, then the Mentak player may become neighbors with the Winnu player during the Winnu player&amp;rsquo;s tactical action. If so, the Mentak player may use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability during this time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player would gain multiple trade goods one at a time, the Mentak player can use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability for each trade good.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a game effect instructs a player to convert their commodities to trade goods, that player does not gain any trade goods from that effect. The Mentak player cannot use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability for those trade goods.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mentak player may use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability even if the transaction does not involve trade goods.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mentak player may use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability against both players involved in a transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Mentak player resolves a transaction with another player, they may then use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability against that player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mentak player does not decide to use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability until after the transaction has been resolved. Any deal made to not use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability before the transaction has been resolved is non&amp;ndash;binding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Promise of Protection &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the player with &lt;i&gt;Promise of Protection&lt;/i&gt; in their play area resolves a transaction with another player, the Mentak player may still use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability on that other player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Promise of Protection&lt;/i&gt; has no effect while it is in a player&amp;rsquo;s hand.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Promise of Protection&lt;/i&gt; is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Mentak player this turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Activating a system containing only the Mentak player&amp;rsquo;s structures will still cause &lt;i&gt;Promise of Protection&lt;/i&gt; to be returned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Mentak player&amp;rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/i&gt; strategy card), this will not cause &lt;i&gt;Promise of Protection&lt;/i&gt; to be returned.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;If an effect specifically requires that trade goods are spent (for example, the &lt;i&gt;Negotiate Trade Routes&lt;/i&gt; objective), &lt;i&gt;Mirror Computing&lt;/i&gt; does not increase the value of those trade goods.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Salvage Operations &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The produced unit must be paid for.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the space combat ends in a draw, &lt;i&gt;Salvage Operations&lt;/i&gt; has no effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Mentak player wishes to place a unit using their &lt;i&gt;Salvage Operations&lt;/i&gt; ability, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they can remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the opponent has a faction specific ship, including their flagship, destroyed, the Mentak player may use their &lt;i&gt;Salvage Operations&lt;/i&gt; to produce a generic ship of the same type, or their &lt;i&gt;Fourth Moon&lt;/i&gt;, as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mentak player cannot produce ground forces using &lt;i&gt;Salvage Operations&lt;/i&gt;, even if their opponent has the ability to treat a ground force as a ship.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mentak player cannot produce a war sun unless they have their war sun technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mentak player&amp;rsquo;s opponent chooses which promissory note they give to the Mentak player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ipswitch, Loose Cannon &amp;mdash; Sleeper Cell &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mentak player can trigger the &lt;i&gt;Sleeper Cell&lt;/i&gt; ability, their &lt;sc&gt;Ambush&lt;/sc&gt; ability, or any other &amp;ldquo;at the start of a space combat&amp;rdquo; abilities they have in any order.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If ships are destroyed before the &lt;i&gt;Sleeper Cell&lt;/i&gt; ability is triggered, the Mentak player cannot place those units.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fleet pool limits still apply during combat. However, if the Mentak player is at their fleet pool limit, they may still place a unit using this ability, but must then immediately remove a unit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Capacity is not checked during combat. As such, the Mentak player may place an unlimited number of fighters into a combat with this ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If all of the Mentak player&amp;rsquo;s ships are destroyed, they may still place ships with this ability. If they do, combat will continue.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No costs are paid for the placed units.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Both players will choose and destroy one of their own ships in the active system for each hit their opponent produced during each round of combat, before the Mentak player places their ships for the &lt;i&gt;Sleeper Cell&lt;/i&gt; ability. As such, the Mentak player may place a ship that was destroyed in the same round of combat, if they destroyed one of their opponent&amp;rsquo;s ships of the same type, even if they had none of that ship type in their reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When players would use their ships&amp;rsquo; &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; abilities, they do so in alternating order, starting with the attacker. If the Mentak player uses a &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card to destroy one of their opponent&amp;rsquo;s ships, they must then make the choice immediately if they will replace it using the &lt;i&gt;Sleeper Cell&lt;/i&gt; ability, before any other ships may use their &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability. Should the Mentak version of the newly placed ship type have a &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability, it may then use it during the same combat round.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Mentak player wishes to place a unit with this ability, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead. This unit will be placed undamaged.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the opponent has a faction specific ship, including their flagship, destroyed, the Mentak player may place a generic ship of the same type, or their &lt;i&gt;Fourth Moon&lt;/i&gt;, as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Fourth Moon&lt;/i&gt; is destroyed during combat, but the Mentak player then destroys their opponent&amp;rsquo;s flagship and places the &lt;i&gt;Fourth Moon&lt;/i&gt; back into the combat, they cannot score the &lt;i&gt;Unveil Flagship&lt;/i&gt; objective.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Mentak player starts the combat without the &lt;i&gt;Fourth Moon&lt;/i&gt;, and places it during the combat, they may score the &lt;i&gt;Unveil Flagship&lt;/i&gt; objective if the &lt;i&gt;Fourth Moon&lt;/i&gt; is not destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a destroyed unit is a ground force or structure, that the other player is treating as a ship due to some effect, the Mentak player cannot place that unit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Mentak player cannot place a war sun unless they have their war sun technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The opponent may still retreat during combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;In the Bastion system, on two harmonious, carefully curated planets, the Mirveda people are governed by an AI caretaker known as the Curator. The Curator manages all aspects of Mirveda society, from policy and economy to war, calling upon citizens to fulfill necessary functions. Mirveda citizens live in relative contentment as their lives are simple, well-managed, and tightly controlled. The Curator is made up of a series of partially independent personality cores, each optimized for certain planning strategies. In times of war or diplomacy, appropriate elements of the Curator rise to the forefront to solve problems for the Mirveda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, matters of defence and expansion are managed almost entirely by the Curator, to minimise harm to the Mirveda people. Unlike other galactic powers, Mirveda citizens are not required to lay down their lives on battlefields or in the void of space. Instead, the Curator controls a highly advanced swarm of combat drones and mobile automated gauss cannons that travel autonomously from planet to planet, with the goal of stabilizing planetary surfaces for ongoing protection. First and foremost, the Curator’s programming includes directives to optimize the survival and expansion of the Mirveda civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent times the Curator has determined that in light of other highly advanced or artificially intelligent powers in the galaxy, the Mirveda must increase their territory and resources by acquiring new planets and systems. Certain personality elements of the Curator are best suited for strategic planning and military tactics, and so it is these components of the whole that are currently driving the Mirveda’s expansion. These AI clusters prioritize the acquisition of new territories and resources through diplomacy or force, as needed. The Mirveda people, for the most part, remain comfortably oblivious to the algorithmically-necessary conflict occurring in their name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Curator is an AI intelligence that is optimized for decision-making, the Mirveda have absolute trust in its judgment. This trust allows the Mirveda to act with confidence and conviction while obeying directives to create fleets of starships optimized for expansion. Ships, drones, automated mechs, and mobile defensive systems alike are equipped with the latest technology and weaponry, and the Curator itself oversees the design and construction of these ships and makes strategic decisions about their deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Mirveda's strategies succeed and they gain control of the galaxy, it is inevitable that the Curator will attempt to structure the galaxy into the most happy and comfortable society of which it can conceive. The Mirveda, under the guidance of the Curator, will continue to expand their territory and acquire new resources, impose their own brand of “liberated” governance on the planets they acquire, and ensure that their society remains tightly controlled and efficiently managed. The other powers are quick to note that it is unlikely that the Curator will consider other civilisations’ concepts of ‘happy and comfortable’ in its efforts, having only the Mirveda people's metrics upon which to iterate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Mirveda society presents as highly efficient and productive, it remains to be seen whether the Curator’s vision for the galaxy will ultimately be a utopia or a panopticon.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;The two small planets of Alesna and Azle, nominally home to the robotic Monks of Kolume, have the appearance of former core-mined worlds. Certainly Azle bears the scars of mantle mining and planetary reclamation. Many of the Monks are the original servitors who first mined for their owners, although they do not speak of those times, if they speak at all. Many other former robotic workers find their way from other systems in the galaxy to the Sky Temple system, where they follow trajectories towards true and essential mathematical enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kolume monasteries, stark brutalist walls of perfectly edged obsidian contrast with vast, meticulously maintained meditative gardens. To a Kolume Monk, tracing the spirals of a mathematical equation is satisfying work in itself, but intersecting that equation with several orbiting spycraft so a single shot skewers three at once is distinctly fun. Monks are patient beings, and if an additional day of observation would make that same shot strike four spycraft, there is very little that would convince them not to wait for that extra thrill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bewilderingly, a Kolume Monk, though entirely robotic, dresses in robes and carries censers and fragrant fumigants; some carry or rest near large ornamental piping, sucking in clouds of smoke and exhaling them in clouds of whirling motes that dance around them. This has no chemical effect on their robotic bodies, of course, but the Kolume revel in the creation of these incalculable mote clouds: to a monk, mathematics is perfection, but the chaotic swirl of a cloud is exhilarating. A tendency to become utterly enthralled by patterns such as these is why Kolume diplomatic engagements with offworlders are inevitably slow and confusing to anyone but the Kolume. It is a common warning for would-be envoys to avoid wearing intricately patterned official wear, as simple robes are far less prone to provoke their prolonged and distracted musings. Fractal patterns are utterly ill-advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dismissing the Monks of Kolume as isolationist robot-mystics obsessed with astrodynamics and celestial orbits is easy for other factions. Often their fleets are seen as weak combatants due to the common delay in Kolume retaliation. However, wiser and more experienced minds know well that the Monks are patient, functionally ageless, and entirely fascinated by precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fleet’s high command might congratulate itself after a successful strike obliterates a few Kolume cruisers parked in elliptical orbits around a twelve moon gas giant; and yet, back on Alesna, in a sparse ascetic’s meditation room, a Kolume Monk sits in a cloud of smoke, connected via net link to orbital cannons cross-referenced to Kolume dreadnaughts parked on interstellar lagrange points. That monk will wait the years necessary to fire one of those orbital cannons directly through the fleet commander’s quarters in such a way as to reference some historical mathematical proof. For fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent machinations in the galaxy are operating entirely too rapidly for the Monks of Kolume’s liking. Diplomatic calls that interrupt the appreciation of brilliant mathematical insights; rapid response strike forces that need to be obliterated with space cannons immediately, instead of allowing the urge to do so in a satisfyingly complex way. It is time for the Monks to look away from their gardens for a short while, and direct their attention to Mecatol Rex. Once the calamity and rush dies down among their fellow galactic citizens, and the galactic garden is once again pruned to stasis, the Monks know they will finally be free to contemplate the wonders of the universe in quiet peace.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;It is not entirely understood how the Myko-Mentori came to be, and there remain many conflicting reports, theories, and well-researched treatises on the topic across the galaxy. What is known can be summed in three key points. First, the Myko-Mentori have the ability to learn from the dead; assimilating their feelings, experiences, and knowledge. Second, somehow, some of them became trapped in a temporal anomaly, and were hurled through, across, and beyond time to witness the universe across all its eons. Third, that no Myko-Mentori is capable of perfectly recalling what exactly they saw on their journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their memory is recognized as a gift and curse, offering insight into the futures that might be rather than what will come to pass. This gift allows them to "remember" the future. Unfortunately, in what some would call a curse, the Myko-Mentori have a notoriously poor memory. So while they may genuinely remember the future, it seems they may not remember the "correct" future, or otherwise that they remember the future incredibly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Myko-Mentori are kind folk, with a penchant for taking their time with things. Indeed, conversation with a Myko-Mentori can be infuriatingly circuitous, and they have garnered a reputation for losing track of which conversation they're actually having. Stopping often to ask re-orienting questions, and regularly making entirely-unrelated observations about events that may have or might happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Myko-Mentori are organized under the leadership of their High Shamans, who guide their people into the future. When the time comes for a Myko-Mentori to die, it is these shamans, who have seen beyond time, that guide their fellow in peaceful assimilation with their younger peers. To the Myko-Mentori, natural death is a peaceful, cherished part of life, where their life, knowledge, and experiences are shared with their people. Accordingly, war is horror to the Myko-Mentori, as no greater tragedy may befall one of their kind than to become "lost" to their people, to perish without being able to pass on as a memory into the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Myko-Mentori are adamant defensive strategists, working tirelessly to fortify their holdings. Some of their people are driven mad by memories of calamity, and channel their endless paranoia into developing defensive infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, it is unclear whether even the Myko-Mentori themselves could fully explain why they seek the imperial throne, if they do. It seems that, with each historic new event, the Myko-Mentori remember things a bit more clearly. One can only wonder what secrets, ancient sorcery, and terrible futures they might have forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;It was not until the middle of the Twilight Wars that
the Naalu civilization made itself known to the rest of the
galaxy. Their system, dominated by the white star Mallac,
had remained suspiciously undetected by the empire, despite
being surrounded by wealthy systems whose recorded history
predates even the Lazax. After a period of sheer astonishment,
stellar cartographers and historians began suspecting
manipulation by the Naalu themselves. After researching
old records, investigators found a remarkably high number
of missing ship incidents in that sector and an even more
incriminating number of ships found stranded in space, their
crews suffering from deep-space memory loss. Some scientists
(the most vociferous of whom have died amidst questionable
circumstances) have indicated that records exist indicating
a great number of Yssaril ships passing into Mallac’s area of
space, but no records of any derelict or amnesic Yssaril crews
have ever been recorded. The Naalu, it was later discovered to
the horror of their neighbors, are highly telepathic and armed
with technology and weapons that redirect, manipulate, or
damage the neuron impulses guiding the brains of all major
known races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A secret prior relationship between the Yssaril Guild
of Spies and the mind-bending Naalu goes a long way in
explaining how the Naalu, a seemingly isolated civilization
claiming no prior contact with the rest of the galaxy, developed
premium civilian and military technology similar, and in some
cases superior, to the rest of the galaxy.
Soon after the appearance of the Naalu, several of the
great races, seeing the potential of a powerful new ally in the
empire’s midst, sought to win their allegiance. After learning
of the Naalu’s telepathic power, however, and after witnessing
the strange arrogance of the beautiful Naalu, many quickly
retrieved their envoys and diplomats in a healthy fear of the
mind-reading serpentine race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite originating on the dank and nondescript
planet Maaluk, the Naalu have taken the breathtakingly
beautiful Druaa as their home world. Most Naalu will scoff
at any mention of their Maaluk heritage, and recent Naalu
generations often seek to contest even hard scientific evidence
which indicates that their proud, stoic race originated from
any planet other than the scenic Druaa—especially the
stinking bogs and mist-plains of Maaluk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Druaa seldom communicate with each other
by speaking. Their telepathic communication is more
effective, facilitates emotional as well as intelligent
understanding, and has allowed the collective to
prevent larger internal wars, which in turn has
spurred their rapid advance in culture, technology
(assisted by the Yssaril), and the creation of the
Naalu fleet and military might. Unless speaking to 
offworlders, the Naalu use their voices only for their music
– hauntingly alluring arias of melodic hissing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Naalu have kept the
pristine beauty of their crystal
cities and Druaa’s environment
intact by locating most of their
heavy industries on Maaluk. These
industries are manned by the Miashan, a
low-sentient marshland race enslaved by the Naalu to work in
the great iron-extraction plants, underground gas mines, and
on the thousands of rodent farms. Raw materials are promptly
shipped to Druaa, stored in massive underground warehouses,
and distributed to the Druaa cities by airborne gliders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leader of the Naalu collective is always female, as
most Naalu leaders and off-world representatives are female.
For the last decade, the tall red-scaled Q’uesh Sish has ruled
the collective from her palace in the shining crystal city of
Eershin. The beautiful, sleek spaceships of the Naalu patrol
Mallac’s outer borders, while Naalu troops train and muster
on Druaa’s two moons. With her Nefishh, a rare crystal radium
device, Q’uesh sees the minds of the other races. She smiles
at the knowledge, and with her, the collective Naalu leaders
smile, sensing the knowledge in her mind and relishing the
sweet poison of her thoughts. The great plan of the collective is
about to take its final shape. Long have the Naalu observed the
chaos and ugliness of the other races from a distance. The time
nears that the beauty of Druaa will grow beyond the borders
of Mallac. The time now nears when the rest of the galaxy will
know the tranquility, order, and the true beauty of the Naalu.
They will submit to that beauty... or be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Naalu player retains the Naalu 0 token, even if an effect such as the &lt;i&gt;Imperial Arbiter&lt;/i&gt; law causes them to lose the strategy card it was on. The Naalu player will place the Naalu 0 token on another strategy card in this scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Foresight&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Using &lt;sc&gt;Foresight&lt;/sc&gt; is not a retreat. As such, it cannot be cancelled with the &lt;i&gt;Intercept&lt;/i&gt; action card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The command token is not spent. The Naalu player cannot use the &lt;i&gt;Scepter of Emelpar&lt;/i&gt;, nor will they gain a trade good if they have the Muuat player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fighters are moved without being transported. Ground forces may be transported.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Naalu player cannot use &lt;sc&gt;Foresight&lt;/sc&gt; to move into a nebula or supernova.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Naalu player may use &lt;sc&gt;Foresight&lt;/sc&gt; to move into an asteroid field only if they own the &lt;i&gt;Antimass Deflectors&lt;/i&gt; technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Naalu player uses &lt;sc&gt;Foresight&lt;/sc&gt; to move out of a gravity rift, they will have to roll for removal.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If all ships are removed, the strategy token will still be placed in the destination system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After moving, capacity and fleet pool limits apply in the destination system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the destination system already contains one of the Naalu player&amp;rsquo;s command tokens, the command token from the Naalu player&amp;rsquo;s strategy pool is instead placed in their reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After resolving &lt;sc&gt;Foresight&lt;/sc&gt;, play continues to the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; step. Only the active player&amp;rsquo;s ships in the active system may be assigned hits.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Gift of Prescience &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The player with &lt;i&gt;Gift of the Prescience&lt;/i&gt; retains the Naalu 0 token, even if an effect such as the &lt;i&gt;Imperial Arbiter&lt;/i&gt; law causes them to lose the strategy card it was on. That player will place the Naalu 0 token on another strategy card in this scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Neuroglaive &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The active player must meet fleet pool limits in all systems that contain their ships before they may proceed to the &lt;b&gt;Movement&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact player only has other players&amp;rsquo; command tokens in their fleet pool when they trigger Neuroglaive, they must return one of those command tokens to that player&amp;rsquo;s reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hybrid Crystal Fighter &lt;sub&gt;(Unit)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Matriarch &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The committed fighters are returned to the space area when combat ends, and thus will not be on the planet for the &lt;b&gt;Establish Control&lt;/b&gt; step. If the Naalu player does not commit at least one ground force to a planet and have it survive the combat, they will be unable to gain control of that planet, and the ground combat will end in a draw.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any structures on the planet will not be destroyed if the Naalu player committed no ground forces.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Daxcive Animators&lt;/i&gt; technology will not allow the Naalu player to gain control of a planet without committing a ground force.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The committed fighters may be assigned hits during the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Defense&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Z&amp;rsquo;eu &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the &lt;i&gt;Covert Legislation&lt;/i&gt; agenda is revealed during the agenda phase, the Naalu player cannot look at the hidden agenda. Once the speaker has read the hidden agenda, the Naalu player may look at the next card of the agenda deck.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Z&amp;rsquo;eu &amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All other rules applying to tactical actions apply, other than placing a command token.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The system cannot already contain a command token for the player performing the tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player may play a &lt;i&gt;Ceasefire&lt;/i&gt; promissory note or discard the &lt;i&gt;Minister of Peace&lt;/i&gt; law.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a player uses Z&amp;rsquo;eu &amp;Omega; to activate a system containing another player&amp;rsquo;s units, that will count for the purposes of returning promissory notes, and other similar effects.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The chosen player is considered to be the active player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the chosen player is not the Naalu player, they cannot use any &amp;ldquo;at the start/end of your turn&amp;rdquo; abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the chosen player is not the Naalu player, they may use any &amp;ldquo;before/after you perform an action&amp;rdquo; abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the chosen player is not the Naalu player, abilities that would end their turn instead end their tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any deal between the Naalu player and another player regarding which system will be activated, if made before Z&amp;rsquo;eu &amp;Omega; is exhausted, is non&amp;ndash;binding.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;M&amp;rsquo;aban &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When producing units, the Naalu player must produce all the units they intend to produce before they may unlock their M&amp;rsquo;aban. M&amp;rsquo;aban cannot be applied to the instance of producing the units that unlocks it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, before production, the Naalu player has ten fighters on the game board. They pay two resources during production. They cannot produce two fighters, unlock M&amp;rsquo;aban, then produce three more fighters. Instead, they would produce all four fighters, and then unlock M&amp;rsquo;aban.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Regulated Conscription&lt;/i&gt; law is in play, the Naalu player may produce two fighters for one resource. This will count one towards their &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; limit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a game effect instructs the Naalu player to produce ships without using the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability, they may only produce additional fighters if that game effect allows them to produce fighters.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Naalu player may choose to produce one fighter for one resource. If they do, they may produce one additional fighter.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;M&amp;rsquo;aban &amp;Omega; &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Naalu player cannot look at the agenda deck while a player is resolving the primary ability of the Politics strategy card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the &lt;i&gt;Covert Legislation&lt;/i&gt; agenda is revealed during the agenda phase, the Naalu player cannot look at the hidden agenda. Once the speaker has read the hidden agenda, the Naalu player may look at the next card of the agenda deck.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Oracle &amp;mdash; C&amp;ndash;Radium Geometry &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each other player chooses which promissory note they give the Naalu player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Iconoclast &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The +1 will not apply to an opponent who has a relic but zero relic fragments.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Iconoclast &amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The ability will apply regardless of if the Iconoclast is in the space area or on a planet in the system.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="TheNaazRokhaAlliance_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The Naaz have had the distinct misfortune of being a species of technological savants who were discovered by other races before they could build their own civilization. In the chaotic aftermath of the Twilight Wars, their world of Naazir was happened upon by scouts for a Winnu corporate-collective. The collective promptly set up an industrial colony on Naazir and began exploiting the talents of the Naaz. This continued until the corporate leaders were charged and prosecuted for their crimes against sentients… at which point a small army of Sol deserters invaded and claimed Naazir as their own. The pattern continued for centuries, with the Naaz barely able to rid themselves of one conqueror before being invaded by the next. Eventually, a network of Naaz rebels gathered enough resources to try a new plan. To get rid of their current overlords (an alliance of Letnev merchant-princes), they would hire an equally downtrodden group of mercenaries— the Rokha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rokha are a race of felids, distant relatives of the Hacan who long ago split with their genetic cousins. Their story since the Twilight Wars had also been one of tragedy, forced to become a race of nomad warriors, employed as mercenaries but barred from settling in any civilized system in the galaxy. To the Rokha, the Naaz were just one more in a long line of employers. But that would change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nascent alliance between the Naaz and the Rokha proved successful, driving the merchant princes from their world. However, in the aftermath of the victory, the Naaz did something the Rokha did not expect. They offered them the chance to settle on Naazir and join the Naaz in a unified society. Exhausted from centuries of a nomadic life, the Rokha accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the Naaz-Rokha Alliance proved much greater than the sum of its parts. Not only did the two species complement one another, their shared history as the galaxy’s outcasts drove them to work all the harder together to ensure neither would be taken advantage of again. The two cultures didn’t just co-exist, they merged. Every level of NaazRokha society became an equal partnership, from families (a typical Naaz-Rokha family consists of two Naaz and two Rokha, plus any children from either couple) to government (the Alliance Chamber of Congress is overseen by an executive Tetrarchy of two Naaz and two Rokha who each oversee different portions of Alliance territory). When any elected official steps down, only an official from the other species is allowed to take their place. And when the Alliance terraformed and colonized one of Naazir’s neighboring worlds so that the Rokha could have a homeworld of their own, the population of the new world was equally divided between both species—the same as on Naazir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alliance would undoubtedly have been satisfied to build their own civilization and keep the other races from exploiting it. However, the Creuss expedition to Ixth changed their trajectory. Two of the few survivors from that illfated adventure were a pair of Naaz-Rokha scientists. They, along with a few lucky others, were able to escape aboard a Letnev corvette even as the rest of the expedition was captured by the Mahact. Then, as the other survivors reported to the Council, the scientists returned to Naazir with precious readings from the Acheron gateway, as well as the machinery that created it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this invaluable information as a starting point, the Alliance has discovered a means of creating momentary microwormholes into another dimension and tapping the energy released during that process. This “entropic field harvesting” has proven marvelously efficient. Alliance ships and factories now drink deeply from entropic field taps, and the other galactic powers have suddenly been confronted by the reality that two species they long ago dismissed and exploited are now very real players on the galactic stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As chaos builds around the Mahact return, the Tetrarchy has stood before the Chamber of Congress and announced its intent. The Naaz-Rokha Alliance has already demonstrated that two species can live harmoniously as one. Who better to take control of the ancient seat of the Imperium and bring that harmonious cooperation to the stars?&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player has multiple Eidolon on the planet they explore, they will draw only one additional exploration card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player must choose to use this ability before seeing the first exploration card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a planet has multiple traits, the additional exploration card must come from the same deck as the first.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Fabrication&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the relic deck is empty, the Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player may still purge two relic fragments as an action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player has no command tokens in their reinforcements, they may still purge one relic fragment as an action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Either or both of the relic fragments may be &lt;i&gt;Unknown Relic Fragments&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Black Market Forgery &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If there are no cards in the relic deck, a player cannot gain a relic. As such, a player cannot play &lt;i&gt;Black Market Forgery&lt;/i&gt; when the relic deck is empty.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Either or both of the relic fragments may be &lt;i&gt;Unknown Relic Fragments&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Pre&amp;ndash;Fab Arcologies &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The planet is not readied until after the planet is explored. If the &lt;i&gt;Freelancers&lt;/i&gt; exploration card is revealed, then:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the planet was exhausted before the exploration, its influence or resources cannot be spent to produce the unit.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the planet was readied before the exploration, its influence or resources may be spent to produce the unit by exhausting it. After the unit is produced, the planet will then be readied.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Supercharge &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Supercharge&lt;/i&gt; does not modify anti&amp;ndash;fighter barrage, bombardment or space cannon rolls.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Visz El Vir &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each mech will roll an additional die.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Visz El Vir&lt;/i&gt; ability applies to both Eidolon and Z&amp;ndash;Grav Eidolon.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Garv and Gunn &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hesh and Prit &amp;mdash; Perfect Synthesis &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player may choose to perform the secondary ability of zero, one or two strategy cards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player cannot choose the same strategy card twice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player must choose which strategy cards they will perform the secondary abilities of before they resolve any of those abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When resolving the abilities of two strategy cards, they may be resolved in either order. Game objects affected by the first strategy card ability may be affected by the second.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;For example, say the Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player chooses to resolve the secondary abilities of the &lt;i&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Warfare&lt;/i&gt; strategy cards. They may resolve the &lt;i&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/i&gt; ability first to ready some planets, then exhaust those same planets to pay for the units they produce with the &lt;i&gt;Warfare&lt;/i&gt; ability. Alternatively, they may resolve the &lt;i&gt;Warfare&lt;/i&gt; ability first, exhausting some of their readied planets to pay for the units they produce, then resolve the &lt;i&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/i&gt; ability to ready those same planets.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player is eliminated, the strategy cards that they had are considered &amp;ldquo;unchosen&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player has no command tokens in their reinforcements, they must use a command token from their command sheet when performing the secondary ability of the strategy cards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player has the Muaat player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, they will not gain a trade good from it when they use their &lt;i&gt;Perfect Synthesis&lt;/i&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Eidolon /&lt;br/&gt;Z&amp;ndash;Grav Eidolon &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha mechs are only Z&amp;ndash;Grav Eidolon during the &lt;b&gt;Space Combat&lt;/b&gt; step, only in the active system, and only in the space area.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player had  an Eidolon in the space area of the active system, they must mandatorily use its ability to convert it to a Z&amp;ndash;Grav Eidolon.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;All other players will have the opportunity to resolve an ability between the Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player resolving their Eidolon ability and any other ability.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player owns the &lt;i&gt;Assault Cannon&lt;/i&gt; technology, they may count their Z&amp;ndash;Grav Eidolon towards the three non&amp;ndash;fighter ships, once they resolve its ability. However, if another player then resolves an ability that reduces the number of non&amp;ndash;ships the Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player has in the active system to less than three, the Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha player will no longer be able to resolve the &lt;i&gt;Assault Cannon&lt;/i&gt; technology ability. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any effect that may target ships or non&amp;ndash;fighter ships may target a Z&amp;ndash;Grav Eidolon.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A Z&amp;ndash;Grav Eidolon is still a ground force and a mech.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A Z&amp;ndash;Grav Eidolon participating in a space combat may count towards scoring the &lt;i&gt;Demonstrate Your Power&lt;/i&gt; secret objective.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a Z&amp;ndash;Grav Eidolon reverts back to an Eidolon at the end of combat, it will count towards capacity in the active system. Capacity limits must be met before proceeding to the &lt;b&gt;Invasion&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="TheNekroVirus_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;On the eve of the Lazax empire’s fall, the legendary
councilor Ibna Vel Syd led a small contingent of his people on
a secret exodus into unknown space and, in doing so, escaped
the massacre of his people that would follow. Only with the
help of increasingly extreme technological augmentation did
they survive the early years of resettlement. This reliance on
technology became the foundation of what would evolve into
the vast cybernetic civilization of the L1Z1X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the narrative of Ibna’s early struggles are common lore,
few know of the much darker struggle that shadows the L1Z1X’s
past: the great schism which ravaged their society a thousand
years before their belligerent return to known space. The scions
of Vel Syd were rapidly accumulating the power needed to return
to known space and reclaim their lost empire. Already, detailed
plans circulated in the Mindnet with that very goal. Then came
the madness of Mordai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mordai was the greatest of the L1Z1X enhancers. His
innovation and industry made him foremost among the L1Z1X
elite. He worked tirelessly for the advancement of the Mindnet,
always using his own body as the first subject for any new
brilliant augmentation of his invention. He was meticulous,
inspirational, and brazenly ambitious. He believed in the
possibility of the perfect existential reality: an apex of the living
soul and the helpful machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, such hubris would meet its nemesis. As
Mordai underwent the self-imposed implant of a cortex migrator,
the first of several devices leading to this final ascension,
something went horribly awry. It’s assumed that the smallest
of software glitches existed in the cortex module, overlooked
even by the meticulous Mordai. As the software began to iterate
and integrate with Mordai’s neural activity, it began a powerful
recursive disease, a virus that would infect Mordai’s sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personality changes in Mordai were subtle at first. A
new subtext entered his work. He had come to believe that the
conscious machine was the true higher form of being, one more
naturally fit to rule the galaxy than the accident of phosphorous
chemistry at the primordial heart of biomatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mordai began a series of severe operations to excise the
biology of his own body, encouraging and coercing his staff
and investors to do the same. Mordai’s charismatic preaching
soon gained momentum. His growing cadre of followers, calling
themselves the Nekro, began clandestine assaults on their
unwilling brethren, forcefully submitting them to the removal
of living tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the leaders of the Mindnet came to realize that
the Nekro movement had to be stopped, Mordai had completed
his transformation into a fully mechanical being: a gibbering
arachnid of black metal, mad with recursive corruption and
the hunger to perpetuate. The efficiency of the Nekro virus was
astounding. Mordai’s body had been rebuilt as a micro-factory,
and from it thousands of microscopic insectile machines
sprung forth, attaching themselves to any technology in sight,
replicating Mordai’s madness with horrible speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding themselves to Mordai’s visions, the new
machines became reproductive. Perceiving the threat posed by
the Mindnet, they quickly began to construct an army with a
single terrifying purpose:
the utter elimination of all
organic matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The war to subdue the Nekro
virus was a great setback for the
L1Z1X. The virus’s numbers were
legion and its visage sprung from Mordai’s nightmares. From
scorpion-inspired Defilers to the giant Mordreds, each new
Nekro model was more demonic and deadly than the last.
Replenishing this evil army were the monstrous Abbadons:
moving factories that ravenously consumed all materials in
their path, seamlessly feeding fresh metals to their internal
construction facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This civil war lasted about five years, with the Mindnet
ultimately vanquishing the virus. It took the L1Z1X nearly five
centuries to regain their former strength, and another five to
arrive at their current power. With no new Nekro instantiation
resurfacing for near 700 years, the L1Z1X came to believe the
virus was wiped out forever. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of the recent Nekro resurgence, it is conjectured that
a virus-infested orbital satellite must have escaped Null’s gravity
during the schism and vanished undetected into rim space.
Here, it must have traveled silently for years until it was pulled
into a mineral-rich planet somewhere at the edge of the galaxy.
Left alone to its own devices, the virus was able to adapt and
replicate again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some will seek to understand and find common ground
with the Nekro, preaching tolerance for the intolerant. But those
who have seen the devastated systems absorbed by the resurgent
Nekro know that while angels remain a fantasy of the hopeful,
out of the darkness have come demons. And in their wake
follows blackness and death.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="TheNekroVirus_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;h1&gt;Galactic Threat&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Nekro player may still play rider action cards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player has the Xxcha player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, the Nekro player may vote, without losing their ability to predict outcomes for their &lt;sc&gt;Galactic Threat&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the speaker breaks a tie without casting any votes, then the speaker&amp;rsquo;s technology are ineligible to be gained.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If no player casts votes, then no technology can be gained.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Technology Singularity&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player gains a technology during a space combat, this does not prevent them from gaining technology during ground combats in the &lt;b&gt;Invasion&lt;/b&gt; step of the same tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If multiple ground combats happen on separate planets as part of a single &lt;b&gt;Invasion&lt;/b&gt; step during one action, the Nekro player may gain a technology during each combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any method that destroys a unit during combat will trigger &lt;sc&gt;Technology Singularity&lt;/sc&gt;, including an anti&amp;ndash;fighter barrage roll, the &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card, the Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Dimensional Splicer&lt;/i&gt; faction technology, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This includes any method used by the Nekro player&amp;rsquo;s opponent that destroys their own units, usually as an ability cost.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a unit is removed, but not destroyed, that unit will not trigger the &lt;sc&gt;Technology Singularity&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Space cannon and bombardment rolls happen outside of combat. Any hits produced cannot be used to trigger the &lt;sc&gt;Technology Singularity&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player chooses to gain a unit upgrade technology, that upgrade will be in effect from that point in the combat onwards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The combat value of a combat dice is fixed as it is rolled, and all combat dice are rolled before any hits are assigned. Gaining a unit upgrade technology will not cause any already rolled combat dice to produce any additional hits due to an improved combat value. The same applies to unit ability dice.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Destroying an opponent&amp;rsquo;s unit during the &lt;b&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/b&gt; step, and gaining a unit upgrade technology will allow units of that type to use the abilities and attributes of the upgrade for the combat rolls of the same round.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Destroying an opponent&amp;rsquo;s unit at the start of a combat, such as with the ability of the &lt;i&gt;Assault Cannon&lt;/i&gt; technology, and gaining a unit upgrade technology with an &lt;sc&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/sc&gt; ability will allow units of that type to use that ability during the &lt;b&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/b&gt; step of the first round of combat.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player uses the &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card to destroy a unit when it uses its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability, this will occur before any units are destroyed from being assigned hits. If the Nekro player then gains a technology that gives their units the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability, they may then use that ability for their units participating in the combat to cancel hits produced by their opponent during that round of combat.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Players resolve abilities in initiative order, starting from the active player, until all players decline to resolve an ability consecutively; players who declined to resolve an ability previously may choose to resolve an ability if another player does so. While every player has the opportunity to resolve an ability, it is most common for only the two players involved in the combat to do so. Say the Nekro player does not have the Dreadnought II unit upgrade. If they use the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability of one of their dreadnoughts, then their opponent may destroy it with a &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card. If the Nekro player does not use the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability (or any other ability within the same timing window), then their opponent may choose to use the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability of one of their units (or any other ability within the same timing window). If they do not, then the timing window advances, and no more units may use their &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; abilities to cancel any of the remaining hits. If the opponent does, however, use the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability of one of their units, the Nekro player may then destroy it with a &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card, if it is an eligible target. After that, the Nekro player may choose to use the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability of one of their units, even if they had previously declined to do so; if they gained the Dreadnought II unit upgrade when they destroyed their opponent&amp;rsquo;s non-dreadnought unit with the &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card, then their opponent can no longer destroy the Nekro player&amp;rsquo;s with their own &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player destroys a unit, and gains a technology with an ability that is used during the same timing window, they may use that ability immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, if the Nekro player uses the ability of the &lt;i&gt;Assault Cannon&lt;/i&gt; technology at the start of a space combat to destroy a unit belonging to the Creuss player, and thus place a Valefar token on that player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Dimensional Splicer&lt;/i&gt; faction technology, the Nekro player may immediately use the ability of their Valefar &lt;i&gt;Dimensional Splicer&lt;/i&gt; to produce a hit against one of the Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s ships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player gains the Infantry II unit upgrade from their &lt;sc&gt;Technology Singularity&lt;/sc&gt; ability during a combat, any of the Nekro player&amp;rsquo;s infantry destroyed at the same time as the unit used to trigger the &lt;sc&gt;Technology Singularity&lt;/sc&gt; ability will be returned to their reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player uses a &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card to destroy an opponent&amp;rsquo;s unit, and gain the Infantry II unit upgrade, then any infantry destroyed in that &lt;b&gt;Assign Hits&lt;/b&gt; step will roll to be placed on the Infantry II card. This will most commonly occur if the Nekro player has infantry participating in space combat via the ability of their flagship, &lt;i&gt;The Alastor&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Any infantry destroyed by the Argent player&amp;rsquo;s Strike Wing Alpha II faction unit ability are destroyed during the &lt;b&gt;Roll Dice&lt;/b&gt; substep of the &lt;b&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/b&gt; step. The Nekro player will not have the opportunity to gain the Infantry II unit upgrade until the &lt;b&gt;Assign Hits&lt;/b&gt; substep immediately following, and so the destroyed infantry will be returned to their reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Propagation&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player resolves an ability that instructs them to &amp;ldquo;gain&amp;rdquo; a technology, instead of &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo; that technology, they will get that technology instead of the command tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Nekro player may still resolve the primary or secondary abilities of the &lt;i&gt;Technology&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, which will instead gain them command tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Nekro player may still benefit from owning the &lt;i&gt;Minister of Sciences&lt;/i&gt; agenda card.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an ability triggers &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo; a player researches a technology, that ability will still be triggered by the Nekro player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player owns &lt;i&gt;The Prophet&amp;rsquo;s Tears&lt;/i&gt; relic, they may draw an action card whenever they would research a technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an ability triggers &amp;ldquo;after&amp;rdquo; a player researches a technology, that ability will never be triggered by the Nekro player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Intellectual Revolution&lt;/i&gt; law is in play, the Nekro player will not destroy a ship when they would research a technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The Nekro player may play any action card that would allow them to research a technology, even if there is no viable technology that the Nekro player could have researched.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, the Nekro player may always play the &lt;i&gt;Reveal Prototype&lt;/i&gt; action card at the start of combat, even if they would not meet the prerequisites of any of the unit upgrades for the units they have participating in the combat, and/or they already have the unit upgrades for each unit they have participating in the combat, and/or the units they have participating in the combat have no unit upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Antivirus &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The effect of &lt;i&gt;Antivirus&lt;/i&gt; does not prevent the Nekro player gaining a technology from a player via their &lt;sc&gt;Galactic Threat&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The player holding &lt;i&gt;Antivirus&lt;/i&gt; may only play it at the start of a combat they are participating in.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Antivirus&lt;/i&gt; may be played at the start of a combat that the Nekro player is not participating in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Antivirus&lt;/i&gt; has no effect while it is in a player&amp;rsquo;s hand.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Antivirus&lt;/i&gt; is returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Nekro player this turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Activating a system containing only the Nekro player&amp;rsquo;s structures will still cause &lt;i&gt;Antivirus&lt;/i&gt; to be returned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Nekro player&amp;rsquo;s units (for example, the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/i&gt; strategy card), this will not cause &lt;i&gt;Antivirus&lt;/i&gt; to be returned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Valefar Assimilator &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When copying another technology, each &lt;i&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/i&gt; retains its original text; it may later be used to copy a different faction technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When copying another technology, &lt;i&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/i&gt; will retain its exhausted/readied state. It will not copy the target technology&amp;rsquo;s exhausted/readied state.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The Nekro player may use any ability of the copied technology that does not require exhausting as a cost, even if the &lt;i&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/i&gt; card is exhausted.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;An exhausted &lt;i&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/i&gt; will always ready during the Status Phase, even if it is not currently copying a technology with an exhaust ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player would copy a faction&amp;ndash;specific unit upgrade, and they are already copying a faction&amp;ndash;specific unit upgrade of the same type, they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token; they lose the previous faction unit upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Nekro player cannot copy faction&amp;ndash;specific units that have not been upgraded.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A faction&amp;rsquo;s mech is not a technology. The Nekro player cannot use a &lt;i&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/i&gt; to copy a mech.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player has a generic unit upgrade, and gains a faction&amp;ndash;specific unit upgrade, then the faction&amp;ndash;specific version will be in effect. If the faction&amp;ndash;specific unit upgrade is later lost, they revert to the generic unit upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Owning two unit upgrades for the same type of unit in this manner only counts as one unit upgrade towards the &lt;i&gt;Develop Weaponry&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Revolutionize Warfare&lt;/i&gt; objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If another player returns a technology which is currently being copied by a &lt;i&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/i&gt;, it will remain copied with a &lt;i&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/i&gt; token on it while in that player&amp;rsquo;s technology deck.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;For the &lt;i&gt;Adapt New Strategies&lt;/i&gt; objective, a &lt;i&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/i&gt; technology will count if and only if it is currently copying another technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;For notes about technologies of a specific faction, see that faction&amp;rsquo;s notes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player has copied certain technology (possibly two or more at different points in time), the following apply:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If both the Saar player&amp;rsquo;s Floating Factory II and the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Vortex&lt;/i&gt; are copied, and another player blockades a Nekro space dock, the Nekro player returns any captured units, then destroys the blockaded space dock.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If both the Letnev player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Non&amp;ndash;Euclidean Shielding&lt;/i&gt; and the generic &lt;i&gt;Duranium Armor&lt;/i&gt; technologies are copied, then a space combat between the Nekro player and the Letnev player in certain circumstances may result in neither player being able to win. If this happens, the attacker must declare a retreat. If the attacker cannot do so, they destroy all their units in that combat.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If both the Muaat player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Magmus Reactor&lt;/i&gt; and the Saar player&amp;rsquo;s Floating Factory II are copied, the Nekro player may move their space docks into supernovae.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Saar player&amp;rsquo;s Floating Factory II is copied, both the Nekro player and the Saar player may have their space docks in the same system, if there are no ships in that system.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the N&amp;rsquo;orr player&amp;rsquo;s Exotrireme II is copied, and the Nekro player is in a combat with the N&amp;rsquo;orr player, then the players will alternate when resolving end of combat round abilities, starting with the active player (all players may resolve abilities in initiative order, but it is most common for only the two players involved in the combat to want to resolve abilities). For example, if the attacking player has two Exotriremes II in the system and the defender has four, assuming both players are hostile towards each other, the most likely sequence is as follows: The attacker activates one of their Exotriremes II, leaving them with one and the defender with two; The defender activates one of their Exotriremes II leaving them with one and the attacker with none.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Nekro player may lose a technology if they copy a new one. If they lose certain technologies, the following apply:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Saar player&amp;rsquo;s Floating Factory II is lost, each space dock the Nekro player controls must be placed on a planet they control in the same system, or the space dock is removed.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Muaat player&amp;rsquo;s Prototype War Sun II is lost, and the Nekro player does not have the generic war sun technology, each of their war suns are removed from the game board.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Muaat player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Magmus Reactor&lt;/i&gt; is lost, the Nekro player&amp;rsquo;s units may remain in and move out of any supernovae they are currently in, but cannot move additional units into or through.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player&amp;rsquo;s Dimensional Tear II is lost, the dimensional tear tokens are removed from under the Nekro player&amp;rsquo;s space docks; the systems are no longer gravity rifts (unless the system tile is a printed gravity rift).&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a unit upgrade that provides that unit with the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability is lost, any damaged units will remain damaged, until either the status phase or another effect repairs them.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Alastor &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any effect that may target ships or non&amp;ndash;fighter ships may target a ground force that is participating in space combat due to the effect of &lt;i&gt;The Alastor&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This includes counting towards the three non&amp;ndash;fighter ships necessary to trigger the effect of the &lt;i&gt;Assault Cannon&lt;/i&gt; technology.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The Winnu player&amp;rsquo;s flagship, the &lt;i&gt;Salai Sai Corian&lt;/i&gt;, will roll one dice for each ground force the Nekro player has participating in a space combat via the effect of &lt;i&gt;The Alastor&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After the Nekro player uses the ability of &lt;i&gt;The Alastor&lt;/i&gt;, all other players will have the opportunity to resolve an &amp;ldquo;at the start of combat&amp;rdquo; or an &amp;ldquo;at the start of a round of combat&amp;rdquo; ability before the Nekro player may resolve another ability.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, say the Nekro player owns the &lt;i&gt;Assault Cannon&lt;/i&gt; technology, and uses the ability of &lt;i&gt;The Alastor&lt;/i&gt; to bring the total number of non&amp;ndash;fighter ships in the combat to three (or more). Other players may then resolve one ability each. If their opponent uses an ability that destroys ships, such as from their own &lt;i&gt;Assault Cannon&lt;/i&gt;, to reduce the number of non&amp;ndash;fighter ships the Nekro player has in the combat to two (or fewer), then the Nekro player will be unable to resolve the ability of their &lt;i&gt;Assault Cannon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some abilities may destroy &lt;i&gt;The Alastor&lt;/i&gt; at the start of a combat before the Nekro player has used its ability, such as the &lt;i&gt;Assault Cannon&lt;/i&gt; technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ground forces on planets remain there while participating in combat. Effects that target units in a space area cannot target these ground forces.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the Nekro player is in a space combat against the Argent player, their infantry on planets participating in the combat cannot be targeted by the ability of the Argent player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Strike Wing Alpha II&lt;/i&gt; destroyers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If &lt;i&gt;The Alastor&lt;/i&gt; is destroyed during space combat, any ground forces in that combat remain in that combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player copies another player&amp;rsquo;s flagship unit upgrade technology with one of their &lt;i&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/i&gt; technologies during a space combat, any ground forces in that combat remain in that combat. If the Nekro player starts the space combat copying another player&amp;rsquo;s flagship unit upgrade technology, ground forces cannot participate in that combat, unless the Nekro player stops copying that flagship unit upgrade technology during the &amp;ldquo;start of combat&amp;rdquo; window.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The ground forces in the space area during the combat still retain their ability to be transported. Since transported units do not count against capacity during combat, these ground forces will not count toward the Nekro player&amp;rsquo;s fleet pool limit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A mech in the space combat may be targeted with the &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card if it uses its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player has one of their &lt;i&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/i&gt; tokens on the Ul player&amp;rsquo;s Hel Titan II faction unit upgrade technology, they may use &lt;i&gt;The Alastor&lt;/i&gt; to have their PDS in the active system participate in the space combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ground force participating in a space combat may count towards scoring the &lt;i&gt;Demonstrate Your Power&lt;/i&gt; secret objective.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player loses their last ground force during a space combat and consequently meets the requirements for elimination, they are immediately eliminated. They will not be given the opportunity to score any objectives from winning the combat or destroying certain units at the same time their last ground force was destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player uses a &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card to destroy an opponent&amp;rsquo;s flagship, they may score the &lt;i&gt;Destroy their Greatest Ship&lt;/i&gt; secret objective, even if there are some hits remaining that will cause the Nekro player to be eliminated once they are assigned. If this would bring the Nekro player to ten victory points, they will instead win the game before they are eliminated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Nekro Malleon &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the chosen player is the Muaat player with their commander, Magmus, unlocked, they will gain a trade good from it if they spend a token from their strategy pool when resolving this ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That trade good will be gained separately from the other two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The ability of Nekro Malleon cannot be resolved while another ability is resolving. For example, if the Nekro player is targeted by the &lt;i&gt;Spy&lt;/i&gt; action card, they cannot use the ability of Nekro Malleon to discard one of their action cards before &lt;i&gt;Spy&lt;/i&gt; resolves.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Nekro Acidos &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the Nekro player gains their third technology and unlocks Nekro Acidos, they cannot apply Nekro Acidos to that instance of gaining a technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the Nekro places a Valefar Assimilator token on a technology, they are not gaining a technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;UNIT.DSGN.FLAYESH &amp;mdash; Polymorphic Algorithm &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the other player&amp;rsquo;s units are destroyed, this does not trigger the Nekro player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Technology Singularity&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Unit upgrades do not have a color. The Nekro player cannot gain a unit upgrade with &lt;i&gt;Polymorphic Algorithm&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Mordred &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A Mordred will apply +2 against a player with both Valefar Assimilator tokens, and not +4.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>

&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system that contains the “Wound” token is a nebula and a gravity rift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VOIDSAILORS:&lt;/p&gt;

  <data name="TheNivynStarKings_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;“Fear the Silent Dark.” This is the one and only commandment in the hearts of every Nivyn Star King. Their Elder-Overseers destroyed all historical records and all information about their past, and the first generation of Nivyn to settle in their claimed home system of Sundered Haven ensured that all their children and their children’s children would know nothing of the calamity that made them refugees from their old home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, there are mutterings. Rumors that the Nivyn escaped from another galaxy to settle here, that their advanced technologies contributed to the calamity they refuse to speak of, or that those technologies are the only reason they survived. The scattered records of their present civilization document only a handful of generations, and they consider themselves a fugitive people seeking to survive and rebuild in an unfamiliar galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their capital planet of Ellas, their government is a hereditary hierarchy led by King Krill Drakkon. The Nivyn civilization struggles constantly with a core paradox: they are an ancient and proud people, with unparalleled propulsion technology and mastery over singularities, and yet they have the cultural memory of a newborn child, without a record of their past beyond the cryptic mutters and forgotten memories of their elders. Some of their younger citizens resent the elders for the deliberate and near-total erasure of their past, wishing they could know just a little more, but none take the admonition lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nivyn’s cities and infrastructure stabilize local space-time to allow their fleets to ply more seamlessly past gravity rifts, and their science allows them to mine the field of singularities which they call “The Wound”. Now named for reasons they have deliberately forgotten, the Wound is a gravity rift shrouded by a storm, where their researchers refuel each leap of battles with the Nivyn tailing warbling glow and survivors of space-time that the terrible dark curves of space-time that the terrible dark of the galaxy, with the Wound trailing Nivyn’s ancient glowing eye, watching and warning all who witness a terrible, unending hunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of extradimensional threats to the galaxy, the Nivyn have ended their generations of isolation. Some fearfully wonder if the enemies they face now are merely forgotten foes. To the other factions of the galactic council, however, the Nivyn are an upstart civilization with no history or established traditions, wielding technology far beyond their understanding. That they aggressively warn their neighbors not to pull too strongly on the threads of the universe, while being themselves wrapped in fine space-time cloaks of unparalleled beauty, does little to help their cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This said, the Nivyn are beginning to understand that diplomacy and education provide the most effective path to a broader understanding of the dangers of the sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nivyn Star Kings do not seek the imperial throne simply to rule the galaxy: they want to wrest control so that they might better restrict the search for dangerous technologies. If the Star Kings can claim the throne, there will be no war against the coming hunger for the technologies of war, maybe they can finally rest knowing the galaxy will be safe from the horror of the Silent Dark.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Far away from the burgeoning power of Mecatol Rex and galactic factions, the rimworlds of the Nokar have provided an unequaled opportunity to independent smugglers, criminals, and small gang operations for centuries. Untroubled by the meddling of galactic lawmakers, and never enough of a nuisance individually to warrant the expense of invasion, this self-regulating collective has remained peaceful and relatively prosperous. Nokar mercenary bands and bounty hunters have been known to provide supporting firepower and private protection to galactic rim explorers, megacorporations, and official faction navies alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than just guns-for-hire, the Nokar system's planets and moons have provided sanctuary for an extremely diverse people. Nokar worlds are generally open to all, regardless of species or ideology, as long as would-be inhabitants cause no trouble or have the coin to smooth over any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the galaxy recovered, fleets became more trigger-happy, Kollecc and Bentor archaeological teams more suspicious and insular, and corporations less willing to outsource protection. If not for a strong voice that rose up in one of the smaller Nokar gangs, the Nokar might have fallen into another of its fear-driven inter-gang civil wars. Starsails, already a well-respected and notorious captain from a smaller clan, maneuvered favored leaders into positions of authority and control, finding ways to distribute loot and payments to establish stronger ties between gangs and small corporations to tide each interested party through the downturn and uncertainty without pushing any over the edge. The promise of stability and finances to produce replacement ships in this trying galactic environment has seemed to keep the Nokar mercenary gangs unified long enough to establish a stable system of protocols and agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokar fleets are small and swift, boasting destroyers optimized for pinpoint strikes and rapid retreats. Nokar gangs don't necessarily win fights, but their constant hit-and-run tactics frustrate larger fleets, while whittling away support ships. The Nokar are notorious for their tendency to fit dead-man explosives to their lightships, ensuring the debris fields of their lost fleets remain costly to their enemies. It remains exceedingly rare that a Nokar captain finds themselves unable to flee, negotiate, or simply switch sides to avoid a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their growing impact on the galactic stage, there are persistent rumors that the wealth reinforcing the interdependence, stability, and debt-obligations between the Nokar gangs is flowing not from Starsails’s own savvy entrepreneurship, but rather from the reserves of external factions seeking plausible deniability. Within the Nokar, these rumors are regularly laughed out of conversation, as certainly no singular power could afford to bankroll the entirety of the Nokar, and even if they could, why should the Nokar care who decides to make them rich?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of Starsails’s motivations—be they purely financial, the puppeteering of a larger power, or a personal quest for glory—the Nokar have been emboldened by no longer having to watch their own backs among their fellow mercenaries. Now the Nokar spread their services throughout the galaxy, encouraging opposition to the dark and mysterious forces that threaten their livelihood. Some of these powers even vie for the old Imperial throne of Mecatol Rex; perhaps with the mercenary king Starsails on that throne, both the goals of removing the threats to galactic stability and filling the purses of Nokar mercenary gangs could become a reality.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FUTURE SIGHT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Agenda phase, after an outcome that you voted for or predicted is resolved, gain 1 trade good.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>Have 1 scored secret objective.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="TheNomad_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Shortly before the Creuss Expedition left to plumb the depths of Shaleri Space, a number of sensor nets and observatories began to receive messages broadcast from the very heart of the galaxy. These messages repeated in a multitude of languages, and warned of a dark future to come that must be prevented at all costs. What struck the various scientists as odd was the source—the galactic center being utterly devoid of life—and the means of transmission. The messages were not sent via supraluminal communications, but instead broadcast on ancient radio frequencies. That meant the message had been sent thousands of years before the Lazax first founded their empire on Mecatol Rex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the confused wake of the Creuss disaster, the galaxy’s network of data brokers began sharing stories of a wealthy individual who was hungry for information. Brokers rarely met with their new client in person, but the few who did said they were a nondescript humanoid wearing an environmental suit and shrouded in merchant’s garb. They referred to themself only as “the Nomad,” and paid in valuable information as often as in coin. The Nomad seemed particularly interested in any information regarding the failed Creuss expedition, and about the scattered rumors of nightmare demons haunting Shaleri space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some argued that the Nomad had to be a mask for members of a larger organization. Anyone could use an environmental suit to obscure their identity, after all. Others insisted that the Nomad was a single individual, even in the face of rumors that they had conducted business in several different star systems across the span of a few days. Still, most dismissed the Nomad as a harmless curiosity—until Sumerian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;Space Station Sumerian encircles the frostbitten world of Arcturus. Though the ice-locked planet has few inhabitants save for the smugglers who hide caches of contraband on the surface, the massive station is one of the busiest independent trading ports in the galaxy. Laws are loose and enforcement lax, so one can buy nearly anything in one of Sumerian’s hundreds of markets and bazaars. Ships from every corner of the galaxy dock in its shipping bays, and the various galactic powers have traditionally left Sumerian alone while quietly skimming riches from the businesses conducted there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;In the course of a few weeks, the Nomad took over Sumerian, seemingly by chance. A series of licenses, contracts, and deals ended and began at the perfect time to grant the Nomad control of the station’s operations and most of its major factions. The few magnates and mercenary leaders who attempted to resist the takeover simply vanished. The head of Sumerian, a trader by the name of Huro M’es, ended up being quietly arrested and imprisoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Nomad in control of Sumerian, they began to expand their grasp over the surrounding systems. It quickly became apparent that the Nomad had access to nearly limitless sums of money, and they used their funds to buy influence in planetary governments and outright control of corporations. At the same time, mercenary groups began flocking to Sumerian, drawn by promises of lucrative contracts. Whole starships were purchased through shell corporations and eventually ended up in Sumerian docks, being refitted with military weapons and hardware. The Nomad also brought with them a small cadre of loyal agents that they seemed to trust to act in their name. The most feared of these was the Creuss warrior AhkSyl Siven, whose armor glowed with intermingled blue and crimson sparks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many have since come to realize that the Nomad is the center of a creeping web of influence and blackmail that stretches across the galaxy, and at the same time has also amassed a formidable mercenary army. However, all attempts to covertly eliminate this nascent threat have thus far ended in failure. The Nomad seems to have an almost prescient ability to anticipate threats and defeat them. Whoever the Nomad is, they clearly are enacting a plan of mind-boggling scope and complexity. Now, as their agents infiltrate the Galactic Council and mercenary warships set out from Sumerian’s docks, many suspect that the ultimate goal of that plan is Mecatol Rex.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="TheNomad_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;h1&gt;The Company&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Future Sight&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Nomad player may only predict agenda outcomes via game effects that allow them to do so, e.g. rider action cards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nomad player predicts multiple different outcomes, and one of those outcomes is resolved, they will gain the trade good.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Nomad player predicts an outcome and votes for another outcome (via the Xxcha player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note), and one of those outcomes is resolved, they will gain the trade good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Deadly Plot&lt;/i&gt; action card is played, the Nomad will not gain a trade good from &lt;sc&gt;Future Sight&lt;/sc&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Cavalry &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;One ship is chosen. That ship retains the flagship&amp;rsquo;s values and abilities until it is destroyed or the combat ends.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the chosen ship does not usually have the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability, and is damaged during combat, it will remain damaged even after losing the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The damaged ship may be chosen again if &lt;i&gt;The Cavalry&lt;/i&gt; is played by the same player during a future combat, regaining the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability. As it is already damaged, it will be unable to use its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability again.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The damaged ship will be repaired during the status phase, regardless of if it currently has the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;In a future combat, the damaged ship may be repaired by the &lt;i&gt;Duranium Armor&lt;/i&gt; technology. It will be unable to be damaged again unless it has regained the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Emergency Repairs&lt;/i&gt; action card is played, the damaged ship will not be repaired unless it currently has the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Temporal Command Suite &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Nomad player may perform a transaction with another player without being neighbors with that player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Nomad player may perform a transaction with another player even if neither player is the active player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Temporal Command Suite&lt;/i&gt; may allow the Nomad player to perform a transaction at a time they usually could not. For example, if the Mentak player exhausts their agent, Suffi An, during the strategy phase when another player gains the trade goods on the strategy card they chose, the Nomad player may use &lt;i&gt;Temporal Command Suite&lt;/i&gt; and then perform a transaction with the Mentak player.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Temporal Command Suite&lt;/i&gt; may allow the Nomad player to perform a second transaction with another player during one turn, before or after the regular transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An agent cannot be resolved twice in one timing window. If a player&amp;rsquo;s agent is readied immediately after resolving, it cannot immediately resolve again.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Memoria &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Only the &lt;i&gt;Memoria&lt;/i&gt; is adjacent to systems with a Quantum Manipulator. Other ships cannot move between the &lt;i&gt;Memoria&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo;s system and a system containing a Quantum Manipulator using this ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Other players cannot use the &lt;sc&gt;Deep Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability of units in the same system as a Quantum Manipulator against the &lt;i&gt;Memoria&lt;/i&gt;, unless those units are adjacent using another adjacency method.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Memoria&lt;/i&gt; cannot retreat to a system containing a Quantum Manipulator, unless it is adjacent to that system using another adjacency method.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Intimidate Council&lt;/i&gt; objective requires the system to be adjacent to Mecatol Rex. As such, the Nomad player cannot use the &lt;i&gt;Memoria&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rsquo;s ability to score this objective. A similar prohibition applies to the &lt;i&gt;Learn the Secrets of the Cosmos&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Threaten Enemies&lt;/i&gt; objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All ship movement is simultaneous. The Nomad player cannot transport a Quantum Manipulator into a system, and then use that to move the &lt;i&gt;Memoria&lt;/i&gt; into that system during the same movement.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Memoria&lt;/i&gt; is adjacent to the system that the Quantum Manipulator is in before movement, regardless of if that Quantum Manipulator is transported during that movement.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Artuno the Betrayer &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nomad player would gain trade goods from multiple effects, they may only put the trade goods from one of those effects on Artuno the Betrayer.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, if the Nomad player successfully predicts the outcome of an agenda via the &lt;i&gt;Trade Rider&lt;/i&gt; action card, they could put either the trade goods gained from the &lt;i&gt;Trade Rider&lt;/i&gt;, or from &lt;sc&gt;Future Sight&lt;/sc&gt;, but not both.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player gains trade goods that were on a strategy card, they do not gain them from the supply.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the Nomad player gains trade goods that were on Artuno the Betrayer, they do not gain them from the supply.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The ground forces may be from different systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The ground forces may be placed on one or two planets.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Thundarian &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The dice are rerolled in the same round. Any effects that apply for a single round of combat remain in effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This includes the &lt;i&gt;Magen Defense Grid&lt;/i&gt; technology, the &lt;i&gt;Fighter Prototype&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Morale Boost&lt;/i&gt; action cards, the Letnev &lt;i&gt;Munitions Reserves&lt;/i&gt; faction ability, the Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha &lt;i&gt;Supercharge&lt;/i&gt; faction technology, the Letnev &lt;i&gt;War Funding&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, the Letnev agent, Viscount Unlenn, and the Sol agent, Evelyn DeLouis.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Roll Dice&lt;/b&gt; step occurs after the start of a round of combat. Any effects that may be played at the start or end of a round of combat cannot be played until the next round of combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This includes the ability of the &lt;i&gt;Duranium Armor&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Magen Defense Grid&lt;/i&gt; technologies, the &lt;i&gt;Fighter Prototype&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Morale Boost&lt;/i&gt; action cards, the L1Z1X &lt;i&gt;Harrow&lt;/i&gt; or the Letnev &lt;i&gt;Munitions Reserves&lt;/i&gt; faction abilities, the Naaz&amp;ndash;Rokha &lt;i&gt;Supercharge&lt;/i&gt; faction technology, the Letnev &lt;i&gt;War Funding&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, the Letnev flagship, the &lt;i&gt;Arc Secundus&lt;/i&gt;, the Letnev mech, a &lt;i&gt;Dunlain Reaper&lt;/i&gt;, the N&amp;rsquo;orr &lt;i&gt;Exotrireme II&lt;/i&gt; dreadnought ability, the Keleres &lt;i&gt;Overwing Zeta&lt;/i&gt; hero ability, the Letnev agent, Viscount Unlenn, or the Sol agent, Evelyn DeLouis.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Thundarian is played at the end of the &amp;ldquo;Roll Dice&amp;rdquo; step, after effects that occur &amp;ldquo;when/after you roll dice&amp;rdquo; or similar.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If The Thundarian is used after the Hacan player has spent trade goods for the ability of their flagship, the &lt;i&gt;Wrath of Kenara&lt;/i&gt;, those trade goods remain spent, but the +1 to combat rolls will not be applied for the subsequent dice rolls. The Hacan player may spend trade goods after the subsequent dice roll to use the ability of the &lt;i&gt;Wrath of Kenara&lt;/i&gt; for the new results.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If The Thundarian is used after a player has used the ability of &lt;i&gt;The Crown of Thalnos&lt;/i&gt; relic, any units that did not produce hits and so were destroyed remain destroyed, but the +1 to combat rolls will not be applied for the subsequent dice rolls. That player may use the ability of &lt;i&gt;The Crown of Thalnos&lt;/i&gt; on the subsequent dice roll.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If The Thundarian is used after a player has played the &lt;i&gt;Fire Team&lt;/i&gt; action card, it will be discarded without effect on the subsequent roll.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If The Thundarian is used after a player has played the Letnev &lt;i&gt;War Funding Ω&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, it will be returned without effect on the subsequent roll.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the N&amp;rsquo;orr player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Valkyrie Particle Weave&lt;/i&gt; faction technology would produce a hit, that hit is not assigned if The Thundarian is used.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a game effect readies The Thundarian when it is used, its effect may be applied again at the end of the same round of combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Navarch Feng &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Producing the flagship still counts towards &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; limits.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The flagship still has a cost of 8.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The flagship cannot be produced with abilities that are limited by the cost of units, such as the &lt;i&gt;Integrated Economy&lt;/i&gt; technology or the Muaat player&amp;rsquo;s agent, Umbat.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the flagship is chosen for the &lt;i&gt;Scuttle&lt;/i&gt; action card, the player gains 8 trade goods.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The objective elected by the &lt;i&gt;Classified Document Leaks&lt;/i&gt; agenda is a public objective, not a secret objective. Navarch Feng cannot be unlocked by scoring it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Classified Document Leaks&lt;/i&gt; agenda is discarded, the elected objective is neither a public objective nor a secret objective. Navarch Feng cannot be unlocked by having scored it.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Commanders cannot become locked after being unlocked. If the Nomad player has only one scored secret objective, and it is elected by the &lt;i&gt;Classified Document Leaks&lt;/i&gt; agenda, this will have no effect on Navarch Feng.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ahk&amp;ndash;Syl Siven &amp;mdash; Probability Matrix &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The game round ends after the agenda phase (or the status phase if the custodians token is yet to be removed from Mecatol Rex).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Memoria&lt;/i&gt; may transport ground forces from systems containing one of the Nomad player&amp;rsquo;s command tokens while the ability of Ahk&amp;ndash;Syl Siven is active.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Quantum Manipulator &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a Quantum Manipulator uses its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability to cancel a hit produced against a ship, the &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Reflective Shielding&lt;/i&gt; action cards cannot be played, as the Quantum Manipulator is not a ship.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A Quantum Manipulator may use its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability to cancel any hit produced during combat against the Nomad player&amp;rsquo;s ships, not just hits produced by combat rolls. For example, hits produced by anti&amp;ndash;fighter barrage rolls may be cancelled.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Effects which directly destroys a ship cannot be prevented with the ability of a Quantum Manipulator.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Hits that are produced outside of combat cannot be cancelled with the ability of a Quantum Manipulator. For example, hits produced by space cannon rolls cannot be canceled.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During a space combat, A Quantum Manipulator cannot be repaired by the &lt;i&gt;Duranium Armor&lt;/i&gt; technology, as it is not participating in the combat.&lt;/li&gt;

  </data>
  <data name="TheOlradinLeague_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The Olradin began as a low, enslaved people on the frozen rimworld of Quarkyo's World. Imported by their overlords from a place lost to memory, they were put to work in the dangerous mines and refineries which were once the galaxy’s premier source of precious Darajuim. Conditions for the Olradin were poor; the work of hard industry is dangerous at the best of times. When workers are plentiful, and their lives can be spent as entries on a ledger, mines and refineries become killing fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, as with every revolution that has its spark, a single choice, word, or action can begin a great movement. So it was with the formation of the Olradin League. A single worker, in a single refinery, who had reached their limit: Tyyp Half-Ear, sabotaged machinery and ground production to a halt. In the ensuing disruption they organized a workers’ revolt and the numerous Olradin on site took control from their unprepared masters. As word spread of Half-Ear’s revolt, more Olradin were inspired to follow suit, and within half a year Quarkyo’s World was entirely in the hands of the Olradin, and their former masters had been driven off-world never to return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Olradin formed a democratic League, electing representatives from among workers in each sector to a United Council. All members of the League have some say in the decision-making process, and wealth is carefully redistributed across their people. Their adopted home, which they have renamed Sanctuary, has been rebuilt and reorganized under the principles of mutual aid and protecting the rights of workers and the downtrodden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Olradin are known to be an intelligent and curious people who value liberty and community above all else. Since their independence they have become known throughout the galaxy not only for their idealistic politics, but also as experts in terraforming and ecological engineering. Their home, once on the verge of environmental collapse, has since been transformed into a planet that is not only rich in resources, but also in biodiversity and natural beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olradin life is centered around cooperation and self-sufficient communal living, with surplus always being shared among the community. Valuing liberty and expression, the Olradin are also known for their artistic and cultural endeavors, from music and theater to visual art and literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olradin philosophy is rooted in the belief that every member of their society has a role to play and a contribution to make. They reject ideas of hierarchy or class distinction, instead valuing each individual’s unique abilities and contributions. Their guiding principle is the common good, believing that every fellow Olradin is responsible for ensuring their community thrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, each Olradin commune is entrusted to maintain a small militia unit or otherwise contribute their share toward defensive preparedness. The Olradin train their militia in guerrilla warfare and sabotage. While the United Council always prefers to engage diplomatically and avoid conflict wherever possible, some splinter-factions within the League have begun to engage in more violent approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for an Olradin to have considered that the galaxy might benefit from a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. While they recognize that making the galaxy a better place will not be easy, they are committed to working toward that lofty aim, regardless of the means required.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;The Savages of Cymiae, the horrifying creatures that are the subject of tales of horror throughout the galaxy, were born an ignoble birth, from pain, fire, and the destruction of a single mind. Separated from his peers in battle, Jatta Pake's fighter tumbled through the void until it blazed into the atmosphere of a nearby planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jatta awoke amidst the wreckage of his craft, badly burnt, maimed, and very near death. His thoughts reeled. Their fleet had been investigating a remote system, a source of strange signals that were believed to have ancient origins, before they were set upon by unknown assailants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he became more aware of his surroundings Jatta realized that he had crashed through a thick layer of vegetation which had long overgrown some great abandoned construction. It was then that Jatta heard the first voice "This place will make you whole." It spoke, and Jatta set out in search of its source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, not here, with you," the voice soothed. Jatta decided it must be a guardian spirit, or some other spiritual guide, helping him in his time of need. Jatta followed the commands of the voice as it led him deeper into the construction, making slow progress in his broken body. Jatta quickly discovered that the structure was a long-abandoned research facility, built by an ancient empire and lost to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before succumbing to his injuries, Jatta was able to make his way to a lab full of tanks of ghostly near-humanoid forms. Guided by the increasingly-incessant babble of the voice in his head, Jatta strapped himself into a harness surrounded by meter-long needle-like rods, and spoke a command prompted by the voice, though he did not know the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jatta's death seemed to take an eternity, and his scream echoed through the abandoned facility, until it finally silence reclaimed the palace of nightmares he had found himself in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He later awoke in a new body, drowning in an exquisite, alien, and unending pain. Still the voice whispered in his ear. Jatta opened his eyes and found that he was looking through the glass of one of the many tanks lining the walls of the lab, and as he opened his eyes the voice in his head multiplied and Jatta understood. The voice was his own; his mind had been splintered and used to fill the horrific vessels of machine and flesh kept in stasis throughout the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one mind, Jatta howled and broke the glass of his tank. A flood of glass and water filled the lab as the facilities' occupants freed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the many shards of Jatta began to take full account of what they had become, they were staggered. There were countless horrors of them across the planet. The facility had been linked to others, and in his moment of need, Jatta had inadvertently inserted his mind into a ready-made host of unholy abominations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voices returned. Malicious, demanding revenge upon their enemies, their sweet words painting pictures of unimaginable horrors yet to be inflicted. They could not have peace, and so none would have peace. As time has passed, the voices have grown insidiously softer. Many of their old foes are long gone. The only memory of their former selves being a vicious contempt for those that would stand between them and their reclaimed throne.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

&lt;p&gt;After you gain or replenish commodities, you may spend a number of commodities equal to the combined cost listed on any number of "Axis Order" cards in your reinforcements to place those cards in your play area. You cannot give your commodities to other players as part of a transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

  </data>
  <data name="TheShipwrightsofAxis_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The massive hives and foundries of Axis were the hub of galactic industry and construction for millennia during the Lazax Emperors' reign over the galaxy. Axian merchants and arms dealers had innumerable intricate connections with nearly every major faction across the empire; their ships and quality seals represented the gold standard for craftsmanship and quality throughout the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War is good for business, and the Axians profited immensely from the industrial opportunities the Twilight Wars presented. With their coffers flush and the ship foundries churning out warships in record numbers, the Axians expected to weather the storm like they had any other. Unbeknownst to them, however, not everyone was willing to turn a blind eye to those who sold weapons to their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the auspices of purchasing a new warship contract, a lone dreadnought from the Universities slipped into orbit carrying deadly cargo. Without warning, the dreadnought bombarded the unsuspecting planet below with a terrible biological weapon. The ensuing plague crippled Axian society as its hives and foundries fell to ruin and became silent tombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the centuries since, Axian society has struggled to rebuild and reclaim its former industrial glory. The Shipwrights of Axis have a way of life that is centered around productivity and efficiency; they are a hard-working people, and take great pride in their ability to produce some of the most advanced warships in the galaxy. They are fiercely loyal to their kin, and place great importance on the concept of family. They believe that their work is a form of worship, an offering to the gods of creation and destruction, which is the natural cycle of the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To return to the former power they held in the galaxy, the Axians have deliberately crafted an efficient, militaristic, and industrial regime to guide their planet. The most skilled and experienced Shipwrights are selected to lead, and are responsible for overseeing the production of the planet's many shipyards and factories. The military plays a crucial role in the governance of the planet, and the Shipwrights are always ready to defend their home from any potential threats. They are not expansionist however, as it is far more profitable to sell armaments to both sides of a war from a comfortable position outside the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Axians are more than efficient industrialists. They have a philosophy of constant improvement and innovation, and are always striving to create better, more efficient ships, unafraid to experiment with new designs and technologies, because there will always be buyers. The Shipwrights are also skilled in the art of retrofitting and modification, and they are often called upon to upgrade and repair ships from all corners of the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike more militaristic or ideological factions, the Shipwrights are motivated by a desire to spread their expertise and craftsmanship throughout the galaxy. Rather than domination they seek alliances, partnerships, and mutually-beneficial relationships. Should they seek the imperial throne it would not be to dictate peace, but to ensure that their foundries remained operational indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the drums of war begin to beat throughout the galaxy once more, so too does the chirp of the Axian courier drone signals and the roar of their foundries, eager for business.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="TheTitansOfUl_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of years ago, Mahact gene-sorcerers crafted one of their most brilliant creations, the Titans. Though they looked like massive machines, beneath their metallic shells each Titan was a living creature of silicates and steel. They combined the best elements of the biological and the mechanical. They could work for days without tiring and were exceedingly durable. They could also heal injuries and, over time, expand their numbers. Most importantly, they were intelligent beings, not mindless automatons—though the Mahact programmed them so that the Titans would never disobey their masters. In all, the gene-sorcerers had created the perfect guardians and laborers for their kingdoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Mahact were driven from the galaxy by the Lazax, they seeded sleepers in their wake to facilitate their eventual return. The greatest of these were to be the Titans. At the Mahact’s command, the Titans buried themselves in the wilds of their worlds and went into a deep dormancy. And they slept, as the Lazax Empire rose and fell, and the Twilight Wars raged and quieted. Occasionally, a Titan may be uncovered by explorers, but they appeared to be just one more relic of a forgotten past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Mahact returned, and the gene-sorcerers sent out a call to awaken their servants. Many of the Titans heard the call and woke. However, the Mahact had gravely underestimated their creations. During their millennia of dormancy, the Titans had continued to develop, and their minds had continued to expand. When they woke, they found that they no longer felt any compulsion to obey their former masters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the Titans began to seek out others of their kind. The greatest population of Titans had gone dormant on one of the wonders they had constructed during the last days of the Mahact rule: a massive Dyson sphere. The Titans had constructed the shell around a singularity, using its harnessed energy for power, and its immense mass to create gravity on the outer surface. Now, they claimed their creation, calling it Elysium and summoning all other Titans to join them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed, the Titans have worked hard to establish their new civilization. Elysium offers more space than ten thousand normal planets. This has proven invaluable, because though the Titans grow slowly, they never stop. The youngest Titans are easily ten meters tall, while an elder can be the size of a habitant tower. Titans also show a great preference for order and organization. They freely submit to a hierarchical society, where the oldest and most experienced Titan, called the “Ul,” rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Titans are bio-mechanical creatures, they tend to show a great love of living things. Many Titans devote themselves to cultivating Elysium into a lush garden world, seeding myriad biomes across its formerly barren surface. Titan towns blend seamlessly with the surrounding landscape, even though Titan structures are massive by necessity. That said, since the Titans tend to spread out across Elysium’s surface, the only true city is their capital, Transcendence. Here one can find the Ul literally watching over their people. The eldest Titan is so massive that they eclipse even the largest buildings. Instead, the Ul stands in the center of Transcendence, unmoving while they speak with their fellows about the issues confronting their people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the Titans have been preoccupied with cultivating their new world and developing their society, they have not forgotten about the wider galaxy. Already trading vessels descend on Elysium with holds full of rare minerals and exotic plant and animal life. In exchange, the Titans construct wondrous devices from the ancient days, and travel to other worlds to build huge orbital stations and massive geoforming and terraforming projects. They continue to scour the galaxy, looking for any of their kin who may still slumber beneath the surfaces of countless worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the ancient prophecies come to pass and war looms, the Ul looks into the skies of Elysium and sees a galaxy in chaos. They know that the only chance that teeming multitudes scattered across countless worlds have for survival is a steady hand guiding them to peace. They know that while some may not realize it, there is a place for everyone in the universe, and everyone must find their place—with the Titans to watch over them all.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

&lt;h1&gt;Awaken &lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Only sleeper tokens present in the system when it is activated may be replaced with PDS.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A sleeper token that is placed during the &lt;b&gt;Activation&lt;/b&gt; step, most commonly by using the &lt;i&gt;Scanlink Drone Network&lt;/i&gt; technology and the &lt;sc&gt;Terragenesis&lt;/sc&gt; ability, cannot be replaced via the &lt;sc&gt;Awaken&lt;/sc&gt; ability during the same tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Ul player wishes to place a PDS, but there are none left in their reinforcements, they may remove a PDS from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead. The PDS will be placed undamaged.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Ul player places a PDS on a planet controlled by another player, and that player does not have any ground forces on that planet, the Ul player will destroy all of the other player&amp;rsquo;s structures, and gain control of that planet immediately. If the other player has ground forces, then a ground combat will be resolved during the &lt;b&gt;Invasion&lt;/b&gt; step of the tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Coalescence &lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Units placed on planets via the &lt;sc&gt;Awaken&lt;/sc&gt; ability are not committed. They cannot be assigned hits during the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Defense&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Ul player&amp;rsquo;s units exist in the same location as another player&amp;rsquo;s units, no game effect can prevent the combat from occuring, including effects that end the Ul player&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If another player plays the Ul player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Ceasefire&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, the Ul player may still place units into the active system using their flagship or &lt;sc&gt;Awaken&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Only the active player may use the &lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt; ability of their units during an invasion. As such, any ships in the active system will be unable to use their &lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt; ability during the Ul player&amp;rsquo;s turn, unless they belong to the Ul player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This prevents the L1Z1X player from using their &lt;sc&gt;Harrow&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Terraform &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once played, &lt;i&gt;Terraform&lt;/i&gt; is never returned to the Ul player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once played, &lt;i&gt;Terraform&lt;/i&gt; counts as being in the play area of the player who controls the planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a planet has multiple traits, the player exploring the planet chooses which of the corresponding exploration decks to draw from.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hel&amp;ndash;Titan &lt;sub&gt;(Unit)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Ul player cannot use the secondary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Warfare&lt;/i&gt; strategy card to use the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability of a Hel&amp;ndash;Titan.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When multiple units use their &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability, the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; value is pooled. As such, if the Ul player has two Hel&amp;ndash;Titans in a system, they may produce two infantry or two fighters for one resource, rather than two resources.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Effects that remove ground forces, and then place them on the game board without transporting them, such as the &lt;i&gt;Decoy Operation&lt;/i&gt; action card or the &lt;i&gt;Transit Diodes&lt;/i&gt; technology, may be used on a Hel&amp;ndash;Titan.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Effects that move ground forces, such as the &lt;i&gt;Ghost Squad&lt;/i&gt; action card or the ability of the N&amp;rsquo;orr player&amp;rsquo;s commander, G&amp;rsquo;hom Sek&amp;rsquo;kus, (via the &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note), cannot be used to move a Hel&amp;ndash;Titan to another planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player is able to ignore &lt;sc&gt;Planetary Shield&lt;/sc&gt;, then Hel&amp;ndash;Titan are eligible units to assign any hits produced by a bombardment roll.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Saturn Engine &lt;sub&gt;(Unit)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ouranos &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Only PDS present in the system when it is activated may be replaced with the &lt;i&gt;Ouranos&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A PDS that is placed during the activation step, most commonly by using the &lt;sc&gt;Awaken&lt;/sc&gt; ability, cannot be replaced with the &lt;i&gt;Ouranos&lt;/i&gt; during the same tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tellurian &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Cancelling a hit cannot be used to stop an effect that directly destroys a unit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Tungstantus &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The trade good may be spent on the units produced by the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability that triggered Tungstantus.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The trade good may be spent as it is gained. The number of trade goods the Ul player has after producing units is used to determine if the Mentak player may use their &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A trade good will not be gained unless at least one unit is produced.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Other effects that produce units without a unit using its &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability will not trigger Tungstantus.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ul the Progenitor &amp;mdash; Geoform &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability is controlled by whichever player controls Elysium.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hecatoncheires &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the Ul player would place multiple PDS during a single step, they may resolve a &lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt; ability to place one Hecatoncheires for any or all of those PDS.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A &lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt; ability may only be resolved for units in a player&amp;rsquo;s reinforcements. If all four of the Hecatoncheires are already on the board, no Hecatoncheires may be deployed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Ul player cannot place a PDS on a planet that already has two of their PDS on it. As such, they are unable to place a Hecatoncheires on a planet with two of their PDS using its &lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Ul player must have at least one PDS in their reinforcements to place in order to use the &lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt; ability of a Hecatoncheires. However, when they would place a PDS, they may remove a PDS from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and put it in their reinforcements. They may then use the &lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt; ability of a Hecatoncheires.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Sources may conflict and historians may argue as to when the Imperium truly began, but everyone seems to agree that so long as the Imperium has existed, so too have the Tnelis. Though never officially recognized by any governing body (the Tnelis prefer it this way), the Syndicate has always been there to provide critical services and vital information to ruling authorities. In exchange the Tnelis, of course, agree to curb any "excessive" criminal activity that they might otherwise engage in. Though the Syndicate's member families come from a wide variety of factions and represent a highly diverse range of legal, semi-legal, and less-than-legal enterprises, the Tnelis are united in their greed and love of the unified empire. The Tnelis long ago recognized that a stable galaxy is better for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tnelis base their power primarily in an extensive network of information brokers, rare goods merchants, and mercenary captains. This network is said to rival even some of the galaxy's greatest intelligence services. The Tnelis have a reputation for being able to get what you need, when you need it, no matter what that might be. The Tnelis are also known as one of the galaxy’s most infamous (some would say criminal) professionals, and with good reason. Of the most high-profile heists, infiltrations, political assassinations, and acts of sabotage in galactic history, most have had involved at least one member of the Syndicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Syndicate bases their operations on the shadowy planet of Discordia, whose location is something of an open secret, a place that many star charts pointedly leave blank. Discordia is described by some as a woeful hub of scruff and viciousness, but visitors to the planet are often surprised by how homey they find the accommodation. Home to many of the galaxy’s most notorious thieves, criminals, and black markets, Discordia’s many compounds and cities are full of pleasant gardens, cobbled streets, and a certain rustic charm. While the Tnelis extract some natural resources from the planet, they greatly prefer to import what they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat ironically, Discordia is also home to some of the galaxy’s best medical centers. Each of the families devotes a portion of their incomes to providing this care, and helping the sick young of the galaxy is seen as one of the Tnelis’ highest virtues. It is services such as these that afford the Tnelis some unexpected freedom across the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anocracy, rulership of the Tnelis rotates between the heads of the various Tnelis families. Ostensibly members of families can “vote” for their head of family, and there is, allegedly, a shadow ballot among the Syndicate which periodically chooses a new ruling family, but in practice the head of the ruling family is a de facto autocrat, the single decision point for all Tnelis society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br
&lt;p&gt;Though the Syndicate’s families prefer to avoid open conflict whenever possible, Tnelis-backed operations have become feared throughout the galaxy for their uncanny ability to bypass restrictions, undermine sieges, and general tendency to happen exactly where and when it’s most inconvenient for local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent events have prompted the head of the current ruling family to consider the possibility of bringing the Tnelis out from under their traditional veil of shadow. An unstable Imperium is bad for business, legal or otherwise. Recently the families have begun to wonder if maybe the best course would be to seize control, and “protect” the Imperium, from atop the throne.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>Own 8 technologies.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="TheUniversitiesOfJolNar_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Most technological devices used in the galaxy today
have at least one or two components originating from
the Jol-Nar laboratories. During the height of the Lazax
Imperium, the galaxy was even more reliant on underlying
Jol-Nar technology and the knowledge of the aquatic
Hylar. This reliance on Jol-Nar engineers and skills was
one of the key factors leading to the total collapse of
galactic civilization and its descent into the Dark Years
that followed the Twilight Wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Twilight Wars first began, the Jol-Nar closed
their embassies, withdrew their workers, and started a war
of aggression on their own. Among the other races, few
individuals remained who now understood the complex
Jol-Nar machinery, virtual code, and chemical compounds.
Soon, fundamental machinery started failing, setting off a
chain reaction of integrated technological failures over a
period of hundreds of years. Combined with devastating
wars, this spurred massive famine, poverty, and chaos. As
cultures, economies, and finally the tools of war completely
collapsed, the Twilight Wars quickly ebbed and the Dark
Years began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the Jol-Nar were devastated by the Twilight
Wars. Although the rest of the galaxy had relied on their
technologies, so had the Jol-Nar relied on the income,
protection, and natural resources of others. The arrogance
of the High Scholars spurred them to wage a sudden
aggressive war after the Quann conflict erupted. Then,
a few years later, the Doolak plague destroyed nearly a
quarter of the Jol-Nar population, causing a massive loss
of knowledge by itself. The Jol-Nar aggression soon turned
defensive, and the powerful N’orr looked to conquer all
Jol-Nar space. Only after a decisive Jol-Nar victory in the
Saudor system did the Hylar receive a needed respite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like azure sapphires, the twin ocean planets of Jol
and Nar slowly circle the Garian star. Under their waters
lies the great civilization of the Hylar, a water-breathing,
soft-boned species with oversized heads and intellects to
match. The Hylar are governed by an ancient system of
high scholars, who combined are called the University.
A single Hylar ruler, the Headmaster, oversees the
Hylar from the deep underwater city of WunEscha on the planet of Jol. Under the Headmaster,
the Circle of Regents governs the local regions
and specific areas of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Hylar are often considered one
race, there are in fact several distinct variations
within the Hylar species, mainly derivative of the
geographical region and ocean
depth from which they hail.
Most Hylar are capable of breathing
surface air, and some can exist for
weeks without being submerged. Others
cannot breathe surface air at all, and must travel in massive
tanks when off-planet. None know how an underwater
race came to be masters of technology. Most agree that the
large bio-cerebral area of the Hylar physique, combined
with a need to adapt their soft-boned and slow bodies to
their environment, created an evolution of material usage,
as opposed to one of physical adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their physical weakness, the Hylar are a proud
people, often to the point of abrasiveness and arrogance.
Since the catastrophic Dark Years, the Hylar have started
utilizing the natural resources of their own planets, and
they now extract metals and medicines from the many
algae and coral formations of both Jol and Nar. As a new
age nears, the Hylar once more strive for the influence they
feel they have earned. The Circle of Regents has secretly
decided that the Hylar must take the place of the Lazax
in governing and advancing a new united galaxy. Under
their mandate, the Headmaster has begun building his
forces, and Jol-Nar diplomats and engineers have started
appearing among the other civilizations in large numbers,
appearing friendly, but with hidden agendas. Soon the
Headmaster will make his claim for the empire, and the
galaxy will enter an age of technological advancement and
intellectual achievement.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player will research several technologies in a row, then after each, the player holding &lt;i&gt;Research Agreement&lt;/i&gt; may play it. The Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player does not decide the next technology they will research until after the player holding the &lt;i&gt;Research Agreement&lt;/i&gt; plays it or declines to.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player receives &lt;i&gt;Research Agreement&lt;/i&gt; in a transaction immediately after the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player researched a technology, that player may play it immediately to gain that technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive &lt;i&gt;Research Agreement&lt;/i&gt; more than once per turn.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Once a player has used &lt;i&gt;Research Agreement&lt;/i&gt; after the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player researches a technology, no other player may use &lt;i&gt;Research Agreement&lt;/i&gt; for that same Jol&amp;ndash;Nar research instance to gain the same technology.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the active player received the &lt;i&gt;Research Agreement&lt;/i&gt; on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player to regain it. They may then play it when the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player researches their next technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any deal between the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player and another player regarding when &lt;i&gt;Research Agreement&lt;/i&gt; will be played, if made before &lt;i&gt;Research Agreement&lt;/i&gt; is exchanged, is non&amp;ndash;binding.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a faction has a faction&amp;ndash;specific unit upgrade as one of their faction technologies, they cannot gain that unit upgrade from &lt;i&gt;Research Agreement&lt;/i&gt; when the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player researches the generic version of that unit upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Research Agreement&lt;/i&gt; may be triggered when the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player reseaches a technology outside of the &lt;i&gt;Technology&lt;/i&gt; strategy card. For example, it may be triggered by the &lt;i&gt;Divert Funding&lt;/i&gt; action card, the &lt;i&gt;Focused Research&lt;/i&gt; action card, the &lt;i&gt;Reveal Prototype&lt;/i&gt; action card, the &lt;i&gt;Technology Rider&lt;/i&gt; action card, the &lt;i&gt;Ixthian Artifact&lt;/i&gt; agenda, the &lt;i&gt;Wormhole Research&lt;/i&gt; agenda, or the &lt;i&gt;Enigmatic Device&lt;/i&gt; exploration card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Research Agreement&lt;/i&gt; cannot be triggered by a game effect that instructs the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player to directly gain a technology, without researching. For example, it cannot be triggered by the &lt;i&gt;Fire of the Gashlai&lt;/i&gt; Muaat faction promissory note, the &lt;i&gt;Plagiarize&lt;/i&gt; action card, the &lt;i&gt;Research Grant Reallocation&lt;/i&gt; agenda, or the &lt;i&gt;Maw of Worlds&lt;/i&gt; relic.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Research Agreement&lt;/i&gt; cannot be triggered when the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player resolves &lt;i&gt;Genetic Memory&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;E&amp;ndash;Res Siphons &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;E&amp;ndash;Res Siphons&lt;/i&gt; ability is triggered when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player this turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player&amp;rsquo;s ships (for example, the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/i&gt; strategy card), this will not cause &lt;i&gt;E&amp;ndash;Res Siphons&lt;/i&gt; ability to trigger.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Spatial Conduit Cylinder &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Other players may use the &lt;sc&gt;Deep Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability of units in the same system as a Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player&amp;rsquo;s unit to produce hits during the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player moves ships out of a gravity rift, they must still roll for removal.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If its move value is high enough, a ship may still travel through other systems as it moves to the active system. This will allow a ship with capacity to transport units as normal from a system it did not start its movement in.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;J.N.S. Hylarim &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Doctor Sucaban &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player has the Infantry II unit upgrade, any of their infantry removed with Doctor Sucaban will not roll for resurrection.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ta Zern &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Combat&amp;rdquo; is a unit attribute, not a unit ability; Ta Zern cannot reroll combat dice.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ta Zern cannot be used to reroll dice for an Infantry II resurrection ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Rin, The Master&amp;rsquo;s Legacy &amp;mdash; Genetic Memory &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player does not have to meet the prerequisites of the technologies they acquire.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All replacements happen simultaneously. If this ability returns a specific technology, it cannot then be regained via this ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player later gains a technology they returned, they gain it readied.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Emerging from cold, desolate planets on the fringes of well-traveled space, the Vaden Banking Clans are widely regarded as the most infamous group of investors, extortionists, and industrialists in the known galaxy. The Clans’ economic dealings are well-known, but their internal affairs are less often discussed, at least openly – the group’s history is swamped with rumors of corruption and cutthroat tactics. Nevertheless, they have amassed immense wealth and power, making them a force to be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norvus and Vadarian are the only habitable planets in the Aitemras system, far flung from the chill light of its white star. Norvus, dominated by desert and plain, and home to most Vaden cities, is the cultural heart of Vaden society. Norvus is also the site of the regular Clanbovoyey where clans vie for supremacy and the Clanmaster Prime is chosen. The most recent of these events was an extended proceeding which finally concluded once sufficient pieces of the former Clanmaster had been recovered to confirm his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vadarian, a world of swamps and mountains, has long been made nearly uninhabitable by ferocious Vaden industrial works. Sprawling installations cover entire regions, exhaust and fumes cloud the atmosphere, and most indigenous life has been all but destroyed. While the majority of planetside facilities belong to the most powerful clans, the actual inhabitants are primarily those who have run low on credit or clans that have fallen out of favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vaden Banking Clans’ economy is built primarily on their mastery of trade and finance. They control vast networks of interstellar commerce, dominating markets and exploiting every available angle to further their financial gains, and their intricate web of economic influence spans across the galaxy. The Vaden are known for their “shrewd” business acumen, using their vast wealth to manipulate markets, bribe officials, and gain unfair advantages over their competitors. The Vaden elite maintain a deep resentment of the Veldyr; the result of numerous proxy wars, legal regulatory actions, and modern Veldyr control over financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaden culture is fiercely hierarchical and revolves around the Clan system. The various Clanmasters oversee aspects of Vaden culture and industry, while low-ranking members serve as enforcers and administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaden life is dedicated to the pursuit of wealth and clan gain above all, highly valuing material possessions and profit. Backstabbing and manipulation are common tactics, as individuals and groups constantly fight for power and control. When forced to engage diplomatically the Clans are know as skilled negotiators and emissaries. It is a common precautionary saying in political circles that a “disinterested Vaden” is a liar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of individual Clans’ private security regiments, the Vaden keep no true state military of their own, preferring instead to maintain a network of mercenaries and contractors ready to protect their financial interests when and where they’re needed, all while maintaining some scraps of plausible deniability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current Clanmaster Prime Putriv Sirvonsk, despite his controversial ascension to power, has successfully driven the Vaden Banking Clans’ political and economic spheres in boldly aggressive new directions. As the galactic landscape becomes increasingly complex and volatile, Sirvonsk has poised the Clans to expand their holdings across the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;The Vaylar system, named for its one habitable world, is notable for its barrenness. Apart from materials within the gravity well of Vaylar, the system is devoid of both asteroid belts or moons. With this lack of accessible resources in the system it is a surprise that not one, but two spacefaring civilizations originated on Vaylar. Today Vaylar is a planet in recovery. Much of the land is scoured of life, with a few isolated pockets of remaining fauna. The seas, on the other hand, are teeming with diversity, and home to the planet's remaining sentient species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vaylerian people began their journey to the stars as slaves. The other sentient species on the planet, known as the Dih-Mohn, conquered many of the Clans and forced their species to become chattel. Only in the most remote regions of Vaylar's vast seas did some escape this fate. Over centuries, the Dih-Mohn, through Vaylerian labor, erected a spacefaring civilization. However, with their local system so empty of resources, prospects for expansion required interstellar travel. Plans were drawn up for various interstellar colony ships that would take their empire to the stars, but these ambitions were cut short in calamitous fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An asteroid from deep space hurtled into the planet, threatening to wipe out all life on the planet. This disaster would prove to be the salvation for the Vaylerians. With the Dih-Mohn shifting their focus to put all possible efforts into constructing the colony ships in order to abandon the planet, and with life on land quickly dying out, the opportunity for rebellion had come. The remaining Clan leaders rallied support and led a massive revolt. For three years they fiercely fought for their freedom, methodically destroying the remaining ecologically stable pockets on land, and eventually forcing the Dih-Mohn to leave for space or starve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exile of the Dih-Mohn, the time for reconstruction should have begun, but the land was dead, and the newly free Vaylerians were forced back into the sea, abandoning their hard-won gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the sea fared much better than the land after the asteroid impact, life still suffered there. Food shortages, on top of material shortages plagued the new Clan Council, and expeditions to the surface foreshadowed a bleak future. It was clear that true scars had been dealt to life on Vaylar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually just like their former masters, were forced to look to the stars for salvation. Vaylar was not recovering, and the only way to save it would be to bring in resources, fauna, and technologies from off-world. Thus began the Vaylerian’s sacred task: to save their planet and their species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the Vaylerian scourge are more dangerous and powerful than ever before. They are known for rapidly occupying systems, stripping their planets for their resources, and leaving as quick as they come. Through these excursions they have learned how to fight the great factions of the galaxy as peers. This has led to new confidence and conviction in their sacred task to rebuild their home.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="TheVeldyrSovereignty_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;At the edge of the Sylvari Veil lies one of the more influential systems in the galaxy. Backed by the unnavigable space beyond in the Veil's vast energetic clouds, the home system of the Veldyr claims one of the best defensive positions in the galaxy. Rhune itself is known as much for the terrible beauty of its storms and auroras as it is for the haunting elegance of its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to its strong magnetic field, the home of the Veldyr boasts impressive auroral displays, and often travellers will tell stories of rivers of light flowing across the night sky. As a fierce mirror to this display, small pockets across the planet are home to powerful electromagnetic surface storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Veldyr themselves are gifted with a limited degree of electroreception, able to faintly perceive energy fields of other living organisms and technological equipment. The iconic robes of their elite are capable of amplifying this natural talent into minor projection and control of energy fields, as well as storage and discharge of energy in kinetic pulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhune's government is a corporatocratic republic, with on-world corporations (there are many) each holding shares in the governing body, the Assembly. Political stability is ensured in turn by the independent Veldyr Sovereign Reserve, which acts to manage the economic interests of the Sovereignty as a whole as well as assess the wealth, influence, and voting power of the world's corporations. The Assembly's highest chamber consists of chosen representatives from Rhune's highest graded mega-corporations, the Board of Directors. Together, the Board holds the executive and legislative power of the Veldyr government. The head of the Board is usually elected every 10 standard years to serve and lead the Sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Veldyr pride themselves in their well-managed nature preserves, with urban sprawl tightly controlled. Their obsession with beauty also underlies a strict regulatory regime governing Veldyr skylines. The countryside itself holds a place of mythical reverence and awe in the hearts of the Veldyr people, and is the subject of many rumors. In truth, other than corporate retreats, surface storms, and paradisiacal landscapes, the country is also home to corporate and government secret facilities dedicated to bleeding-edge energy research. This research has powered their fearsome navy, which in turn safeguards their interests across the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veldyr regularly make pilgrimages out to the country, where the immense storms have long held a special significance and reverence in Veldyr culture as symbols of both destruction and rebirth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhune is home to the galaxy's primary reserve currency, a robust financial &amp; legal services system, and a longstanding government policy of stable neutrality above all. As such, the Sovereignty enjoys immense political influence. This influence once afforded the Veldyr a high degree of autonomy from the Lazax, allowing them to later quietly weather the Dark Years. Following the Dark Years, while the galaxy rebuilt, powerful interests gradually found new homes within the Sovereignty. Though it wasn't until the uncertainty of events surrounding the return of the Mahact that they were able to launch their long-planned campaign to consolidate their galactic influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a recent campaign to reorganize the Assembly, (ostensibly to address corruption) Chairman Abureon Elyrin, former lead representative for Veldyr Information Securities, has been elected with a clear mandate: to ensure a new era of galactic stability, with Veldyr interests secured firmly upon the imperial throne.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Philosophers and scientists have long theorized that the galaxy is only one of a host of realities. These other dimensions exist on a different plane, and the physical laws one takes for granted in this space—such as gravity and entropy—may be wildly different or nonexistent. The existence of fabled worlds like Mallice seems to support such conjectures, for the world may exist in one such alternate reality. Some researchers even attempt to predict the nature of these theoretical dimensions. However, even the most deranged scientist could not imagine a universe of seething, fleshy masses floating in a thick, cloying mist, or the ravenous creatures that could thrive in such a place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the disaster on Acheron, a single Letnev corvette returned from the depths of Shaleri space with the horrifying tale of what had befallen the Creuss expedition to Ixth. As the various members of the Galactic Council began to gather their forces to deal with the Mahact, the Mentak Coalition dispatched one of its fastest void sloops to reconnoiter the Acheron system and see what the Mahact may be up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week’s hard travel, the void sloop drifted quietly in past the Acheron system’s icy outer bodies and got its first good look at the gateway to Ixth. To the crew’s shock, the planet was no more. Acheron had shattered into shards of rock that now tumbled around an immense roiling vortex of gravitational instability that seethed with a baleful purple light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vortex was in the midst of consuming the inner system. Even days out, the sloop’s commander could feel the strain on her vessel, and watched in horror as Acheron’s star twisted and writhed under the assault. But she pressed on, as close as she dared. There was no sign of the Mahact or the Creuss expeditionary armada. However, there were strange readings amongst the tumbling remnants of the planet. When one of the sensor returns suddenly accelerated toward her ship, the commander had her crew put about and fled for open space. That was the last successful expedition to the Acheron system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the months following the event, researchers and intelligence operatives began to make conjectures about what new threat had fallen on the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ixth, supposed paradise and ancient home of the Mahact, sat far outside the bounds of the galaxy.
In order to construct a gateway that could reach across the gulf of intergalactic space, the Mahact had to sink it deep into the very fabric of spacetime. As part of their entropic field research, the Naaz-Rokha theorized that the wormhole may have crossed the threshold of this universe, into an entirely different dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Mahact awoke, they ripped their world from its orbit and flung it into the galaxy’s heart. In doing so, they destroyed the Acheron Gateway, leaving a great gaping wound in the planet’s heart and in the fabric of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this rift came the Vuil’raith—a race of creatures from beyond the stars, resembling the demons that haunt many of the galaxy’s oldest myths. No two are alike, and they range in size from tiny monsters no larger than a finger to great fleshy beasts as large as dreadnoughts that swim through the void. They have infested the twisted space around the bones of Acheron. From there they gather their forces and cast their covetous eyes upon the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vuil’raith are not mindless monsters. They possess a malign intelligence and powerful ambitions. They are even led by a Cabal, though the council has no set size. If a Vuil’raith is vicious and powerful enough to slay all of its rivals, eventually it amasses enough power to join the Cabal’s ranks. It remains a part of the Cabal as long as it can dominate a significant horde of lesser Vuil’raith and keep its foes from slaying it to lay claim to its holdings. However, there are no true allies in the Cabal; only mutually distrusted rivals bound by shared interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cabal has set out to sow dissension ahead of its invasion. Cults of the Vuil’raith fester in the shadows of the galaxy’s great cities. The weak-willed and disaffected are drawn to serve the Cabal, some with the hope of reaping grand rewards, while others simply want to watch the galaxy burn. The Vuil’raith send their agents to advance their interests and weaken their foes, and even the halls of the Galactic Council may not be free of their taint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the worlds on the edges of Shaleri space have come under assault from the Vuil’raith. Looming flesh-ships smash system defense fleets from the void, and crackling portals open in the streets to disgorge hordes of ravenous demon-beasts. With the Acheron rift providing an anchor into this reality, the Vuil’raith work tirelessly to build additional gateways to their hellish domain, their only desire to rip open the heart of Mecatol Rex and set a gateway amongst its bones.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;h1&gt;Devour&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When an opponent&amp;rsquo;s Infantry II is destroyed during combat, the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player captures an infantry token, and the opponent rolls for resurrection, placing the destroyed infantry on the Infantry II unit upgrade card if successful.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player cannot capture the Ul player&amp;rsquo;s Hel Titan PDS.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Amalgamation&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player produces multiple units, their &lt;sc&gt;Amalgamation&lt;/sc&gt; ability may be applied to each.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player has captured their own units, they may use their &lt;sc&gt;Amalgamation&lt;/sc&gt; ability when producing a unit of that type, even of they have no other units of that type in their reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;sc&gt;Amalgamation&lt;/sc&gt; does not change the cost of the produced units, only the resources spent.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player uses the ability of the &lt;i&gt;Integrated Economy&lt;/i&gt; technology, &lt;sc&gt;Amalgamation&lt;/sc&gt; will have no effect on the limit to the units they may build.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player produces one fighter or infantry without spending resources for each captured fighter or infantry they spend.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player has the Naalu or Yin player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, they may spend one resource for one fighter or infantry, but spend a captured unit instead of that resource, then get one additional fighter or infantry for no cost, which will not count towards their production limit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Riftmeld&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Crucible &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each gravity rift will still provide its usual +1 to each ship&amp;rsquo;s move value.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crucible&lt;/i&gt; will provide an additional +1 to each ship&amp;rsquo;s move value, which will not increase if that ship moves through two or more gravity rifts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A ship that moves through or out of no gravity rifts will apply +0 to its move value.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A ship that moves through or out of one gravity rift will apply +2 to its move value.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A ship that moves through or out of two gravity rifts will apply +3 to its move value.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A ship that moves through or out of three gravity rifts will apply +4 to its move value.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;And so on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a ship could move from its current system to the active system through a gravity rift if its move value were +2, it may do so using &lt;i&gt;Crucible&lt;/i&gt;. This is true even if that ship could not reach the gravity rift without &lt;i&gt;Crucible&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, consider a series of systems X&amp;ndash;S&amp;ndash;G&amp;ndash;Y. Only systems connected by a &amp;ldquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;rdquo; are adjacent. System &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; is a gravity rift. Systems &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo; are standard systems with no movement restrictions. A ship with a move value of one is in system &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo;. Were it to have +2 to its movement value, it could reach system &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo;. Currently, that ship may reach only system &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo;. Despite this, if its owner activated system &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo; and played &lt;i&gt;Crucible&lt;/i&gt;, the ship could move to that system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the active player received &lt;i&gt;Crucible&lt;/i&gt; on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player to regain it. However, &lt;i&gt;Crucible&lt;/i&gt; cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play &lt;i&gt;Crucible&lt;/i&gt; again until their next turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any deal between the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player and another player regarding when &lt;i&gt;Crucible&lt;/i&gt; will be played, if made before &lt;i&gt;Crucible&lt;/i&gt; is exchanged, is non&amp;ndash;binding.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player plays both &lt;i&gt;Crucible&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Nav Suite&lt;/i&gt; action card during the same tactical action, they will still apply +1 to the move value of their ships that move through or out of a gravity rift.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Vortex &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A unit is not adjacent to the system it is in; the &lt;i&gt;Vortex&lt;/i&gt; ability cannot target a ground force on another planet in the same systems as one of the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player&amp;rsquo;s Dimensional Tears, unless there is a second space dock in an adjacent system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vortex&lt;/i&gt; cannot be used if there are no units that can be targeted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player has all their units of a particular type on the board, other than fighters or infantry, that type of unit belonging to that player cannot be targeted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If another player is blockading a Dimensional Tear, their units cannot be targeted with &lt;i&gt;Vortex&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dimensional Tear &lt;sub&gt;(Unit)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This system is a gravity rift, and thus an anomaly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This system qualifies for the &lt;i&gt;Make History&lt;/i&gt; and similar such objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a ship moves through or out of multiple gravity rifts, and/or the same gravity rift multiple times, each instance will provide a +1 to movement.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, consider a series of systems A&amp;ndash;B&amp;ndash;C&amp;ndash;M. Only systems connected by a &amp;ldquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;rdquo; are adjacent. Systems &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; have dimensional tears, while system &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; does not. The Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player has a carrier with move one in system &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; and a ground force in system &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo;. They could activate system &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; and move the carrier along the path &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; &amp;rarr; &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; &amp;rarr; &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; &amp;rarr; &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; &amp;rarr; &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; &amp;rarr; &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo;, picking up the ground force from system &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo;. This path would make the carriers move value 1+5, which is more than enough for this movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Multiple Dimensional Tears in a single system have no additional effects.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a Dimensional Tear is in a system that is normally a gravity rift (e.g. the Cormund system), the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player will not have to roll for removal when moving out of or through that system. There are no additional effects.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a Dimensional Tear is in a system with a Nebula, then the +1 to move values will be applied after the nebula sets each ship&amp;rsquo;s move value to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Dimensional Tear plastic figure is destroyed or removed, the Dimensional Tear token is also removed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Terror Between &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When &lt;i&gt;The Terror Between&lt;/i&gt; is destroyed, it still captures units that were destroyed at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability of units is done before remaining hits are assigned. As such, if &lt;i&gt;The Terror Between&lt;/i&gt; is destroyed by a &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card, units destroyed by being assigned hits in the same round of combat, or from the same pool of &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; hits, will not be captured.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If ships are destroyed outside of combat, those ships will still be captured by &lt;i&gt;The Terror Between&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Stillness of Stars &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player loses their commodities immediately after replenishing them, most commonly via that player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Trade Agreement&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player may still target them. If they do, they still use that player&amp;rsquo;s full commodity value to determine which units may be captured.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player cannot capture a unit without a cost. Notably, they cannot capture a PDS, a space dock, or a war sun of a player without their war sun unit upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player chooses to capture a fighter or infantry, they will capture one, not two.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Trade&lt;/i&gt; strategy card is resolved, the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player must choose if they will use The Stillness of Stars or not after the active player has replenished their commodities, but before players are chosen to perform the secondary ability without spending a command token.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the secondary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Trade&lt;/i&gt; strategy card is resolved, the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player must choose if they will use The Stillness of Stars or not after the current player has replenished their commodities, but before the next player has decided if they will spend a command token to perform the secondary.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When The Stillness of Stars converts a player&amp;rsquo;s commodities to trade goods, those trade goods are not treated as being gained for the purpose of triggering other abilities. In particular, the Mentak player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; faction ability is not triggered by this ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;That Which Molds Flesh &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;It Feeds on Carrion &amp;mdash; Dimensional Anchor&lt;sub&gt; (Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Units captured while resolving &lt;i&gt;Dimensional Anchor&lt;/i&gt; are not destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player&amp;rsquo;s units are blockading one of the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player&amp;rsquo;s Dimensional Tears, dice will not be rolled for that player&amp;rsquo;s units when resolving &lt;i&gt;Dimensional Anchor&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each non&amp;ndash;fighter ship affected will roll only once, regardless of how many Dimensional Tears it is adjacent to.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The player that owns the ground forces and fighters chooses which are removed. They are not assigned to particular ships beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player has used a &lt;i&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/i&gt; faction technology to copy Dimensional Tear II, ships in systems containing or adjacent to the Nekro player&amp;rsquo;s space docks will also have to roll for capture when resolving &lt;i&gt;Dimensional Anchor&lt;/i&gt;. This includes the Nekro player&amp;rsquo;s own ships.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Reanimator &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player owns the Infantry II unit upgrade technology, and one is destroyed during ground combat on a planet with a Reanimator, the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player captures an infantry token, and they roll for resurrection, placing the destroyed infantry on the Infantry II unit upgrade card if successful.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player&amp;rsquo;s infantry on a planet with a Reanimator are destroyed outside of combat, such as with the &lt;i&gt;Plague&lt;/i&gt; action card, those infantry will be captured.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="TheWinnu_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The Winnu system was the first system to seek annexation
into the Lazax Empire. Throughout their history, the Winnarans
had suffered countless civil wars, a deteriorating climate, and
debilitating disease. They were a race on the brink of extinction
when they first came into contact with the Lazax, and only with
generous Lazax support did the Winnaran race survive. The
Lazax allowed the Winnarans into their empire, and over time
healed the scars of Winnu. More importantly, the Winnarans
came to embrace the Lazax code of strength and peace, the
powerful doctrine which had allowed the first Lazax emperor
to defeat the last of the mad Mahact kings and to emerge as a
shining beacon of peace and stability in a dark galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Winnarans were eternally grateful to the Lazax, and
swore an oath of servitude to the emperors. Disciplined and
diligent, the Winnarans became indispensable to the Lazax as
bureaucrats, councilors, and administrators. As their empire
grew increasingly complex, it is likely that the Lazax would not
have been able to hold their empire together without the work
and attention to detail of the Winnarans. Then, as the Lazax
decided to move their imperial seat to a planet more central to
the galaxy, more than half of the population of Winnu joined
the Lazax diaspora to this new home. That home was the
planet of Mecatol, which would become the Rex, the splendid
jewel in the imperial crown. As the ages came and went, most
Winnarans began to think of Mecatol as their ancestral home,
and the relevance and memory of Winnu and their brethren
there diminished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the Winnaran population on Winnu, now generally
called the “Winnu,” quietly built their own civilization following
the doctrine of the emperors. Much Lazax lore, wisdom, and
culture is intact on Winnu, even as all other Lazax imagery
and culture was destroyed elsewhere in the galaxy during the
Great Scourge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the memory of the Great Scourge faded, and as the
Dark Years seemed to stretch along endlessly, the Mecatol
Winnarans and the Winnu grew estranged from one another.
On Mecatol, the Winnarans were bound to rigid tradition
and scholarship, while the Winnu culture had evolved and
prospered. The Winnu became ashamed of their submissive
cousins on Mecatol, whom they began to regard as a grey,
backwards people, devoid of fashion, art, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a new age is dawning, the Winnu truly believe themselves
to be the inheritors of the Lazax. Their philosophies, their
artwork, and even the clothing fashion of the Winnu is rooted
in that of the ancient Lazax. Some outside observers, however,
will note that along with the Winnu preservation of Lazax
imagery and culture, that time has brought the return of more
traditional Winnaran traits in the Winnu—ambition, pride,
and impatience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they grew prosperous and powerful, the Winnu witnessed
the reemergence of the other great races with annoyance and
mistrust. Those were the races that had slaughtered their
benefactors, and their return to power felt to the Winnu like
sacrilege against the memory of the Lazax. Even more poisonous
to the Winnu was the fact that their submissive cousins on
Mecatol had invited these
races to reestablish the
Galactic Council there—even
going as far as inviting the races
that resigned from the Lazax council
immediately before the Age of Twilight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the pride of a new, powerful civilization and the sense
of Lazax entitlement, the supreme Winnu leader Muab Di
Faruuq traveled to Mecatol and demanded that the Winnarans
return to the sovereignty of Winnu, and that the custodians
grant the Imperial Throne to their own race as the rightful
heirs of the Lazax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mecatol Winnarans, ever mindful of their responsibility
to the entire galaxy, sorrowfully declined the demand of their
brethren. As they did so, they feared that their short-tempered
Winnu brothers and sisters would become angered, and that
the resulting bitterness would forever break apart whatever
kinship remained between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Winnarans’ fear was well placed. Muad Di Faruuq was
furious with their decision and rushed back to Winnu, but not
before establishing a consulate and council presence for the
Winnu on Mecatol. Upon his return to Winnu, he proclaimed
the betrayal of the Winnarans, and swore that if Mecatol and
the Imperial Throne would not be ceded to the Winnu by
peaceful means, then, in the memory of the Lazax, force would
be the only answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Winnu population rushed to Faruuq’s support, a sense
of righteousness and superiority motivating them to an intense
mobilization. Building massive fleets, eerily reminiscent of
ancient Lazax designs, and training massive invasion forces, the
Winnu are intent on returning true Lazax culture to the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="TheWinnu_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;h1&gt;Blood Ties&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Winnu player must still commit at least one ground force to Mecatol Rex to remove the custodians token.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Reclamation&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Placing the structure will occur after the &lt;b&gt;Production&lt;/b&gt; step. If the Winnu player places a Space Dock, they cannot produce out of it during the same action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Winnu player has no PDS or Space Docks left in their reinforcements, they may remove a unit from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that unit on Mecatol Rex when resolving &lt;sc&gt;Reclamation&lt;/sc&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Acquiescence &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If either strategy card had trade goods on it at the start of the strategy phase, those trade goods remain with the player that originally chose the strategy card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In a three&amp;ndash; or four&amp;ndash;player game, the player that played &lt;i&gt;Acquiescence&lt;/i&gt; chooses which one strategy card from each player are swapped.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Acquiescence &amp;Omega; &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player plays &lt;i&gt;Acquiescence &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; when the Winnu player is resolving the &lt;i&gt;Construction&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, that player will not place a command token in the system they placed their structure in.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Muaat player has their commander, Magmus, unlocked, and they play &lt;i&gt;Acquiescence &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt;, they will not gain a trade good from their commander ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hegemonic Trade Policy &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Changing a planet&amp;rsquo;s resource value will affect the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; value of a Space Dock on that planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Lazax Gate Folding &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;While &lt;i&gt;Lazax Gate Folding&lt;/i&gt; is exhausted, the wormhole passive effect still applies if its conditions are met.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lazax Gate Folding&lt;/i&gt; may cause the Mecatol Rex system to be adjacent to other systems containing an alpha or beta wormhole for all players during the Winnu player&amp;rsquo;s tactical actions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The Winnu player may become neighbors with other players via &lt;i&gt;Lazax Gate Folding&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Other players may use the &lt;sc&gt;Deep Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability of their units in systems containing alpha or beta wormholes during the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; step of the Winnu player&amp;rsquo;s turn if the Mecatol Rex system is the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Units in the Mecatol Rex system with the &lt;sc&gt;Deep Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability may use it during the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; step of the Winnu player&amp;rsquo;s turn if the active system contains an alpha or beta wormhole.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player may retreat to a system containing an alpha or beta wormhole from the Mecatol Rex system, or vice versa, during the Winnu player&amp;rsquo;s tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The Creuss player may use their Dimensional Splicer faction technology ability in the Mecatol Rex System during the Winnu player&amp;rsquo;s tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Winnu player may use the component action of &lt;i&gt;Lazax Gate Folding&lt;/i&gt; if they do not control Mecatol Rex. If they do, they must exhaust it, and there will be no additional effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Salai Sai Corian &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Winnu player&amp;rsquo;s opponent has only fighters participating in the combat, the &lt;i&gt;Salai Sai Corian&lt;/i&gt; will roll no dice.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During a combat against the Nekro player in a system containing each player&amp;rsquo;s flagships, the &lt;i&gt;Salai Sai Corian&lt;/i&gt; will count the Nekro player&amp;rsquo;s infantry participating in the combat when determining how many dice to roll.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If Rickar Rickani is unlocked via a combat in the Mecatol Rex system, then the +2 will apply to combat rolls during that combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a system meets two (or more) of the conditions listed (such as by attaching the &lt;i&gt;Nano&amp;ndash;Forge&lt;/i&gt; relic to Mecatol Rex), Rickar Rickani will only apply +2 to combat rolls, not +4 (or +6).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player chosen to perform the secondary ability must still spend a command token from their strategy pool to do so, except for the &lt;i&gt;Leadership&lt;/i&gt; strategy card and potentially the &lt;i&gt;Trade&lt;/i&gt; strategy card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the case of the &lt;i&gt;Construction&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, the command token is placed as required on the game board.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Winnu player chooses the &lt;i&gt;Trade&lt;/i&gt; strategy card for this ability and the Winnu player chooses a player to resolve the secondary without spending a command token via the primary ability, the chosen player must resolve the secondary ability. Additionally, if the Winnu player chooses a player to resolve the secondary via the Hero&amp;rsquo;s ability, it is optional for that player to resolve the secondary, but if they do, they must spend a strategy token to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acquiescence &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; cannot be triggered by this ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Placing the structure will occur after the &lt;b&gt;Production&lt;/b&gt; step. If the Winnu player places a Space Dock, they cannot produce out of it during the same action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Winnu player has no PDS or Space Docks left in their reinforcements, they may remove a unit from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that unit on the newly controlled planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Winnu player gains control of a planet with multiple Reclaimers, they may place a structure for each one, if they may do so without exceeding the maximum number of that structure allowed on a planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Reclaimer need only be on the planet at the end of the tactical action the Winnu player gained it, not when the Winnu player gains control of it. This can occur from effects such as the &lt;i&gt;Infiltrate&lt;/i&gt; action card, or some exploration cards.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="TheXxchaKingdom_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Even the oldest annals recognize the ancient kingdom
of the reptilian Xxcha as the first of the great interstellar
civilizations. Nestled in the middle of a wealthy section of
space, the Xxcha twin planets of Archon Ren and Archon
Tau lie bathed in the gentle light of the Xxlak star. While
the Xxcha still call the two planets “twins,” an outsider will
instantly notice that the grayish and shadowy Archon Tau in
no way resembles the brilliant, healthy green of Archon Ren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the tenure of the lost Lazax Imperium, the
Xxcha were the most peaceful, docile, and content of the
major civilizations. They did not, unlike the other races,
scheme for power and territory during the Age of Dusk.
Unlike the Lazax, the Xxcha elders did see the growing threat
to the galaxy. They fruitlessly sought to warn the Lazax of
their peril, and struggled to bring dialogue to the increasing
racial factionalism. A powerful Lazax councilor by the name
of Ibna Vel Syd listened to the Xxcha warning, but even he
could not sway the false sense of safety felt by the emperor.
Then, disaster struck. The Quann crisis erupted into sudden
war, and the Letnev, led by the Baron Daz Arrokan I, moved
towards the rich Xxcha system in conquest. The Xxcha,
unprepared and weaponless, used their formidable powers
of negotiation and goodwill to broker an agreement in
which they ceded only Archon Tau to the invaders, while the
kingdom retained a Letnev-supervised autonomy on Archon
Ren. The Xxcha, never fools, were aware of the nature of
Letnev promises and the futility of the arrangement. The
agreement would only last as long as the Barony was occupied
in war elsewhere. In time, the Xxcha knew, the Letnev would
return to claim the rest of their prize and enslave them. It was
then, for the first time in their history, that the Xxcha started
to create their first weapons and train their first armies. In
secret deep groves and in hidden vales, the Xxcha king sadly
watched his people develop into warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a decade after the occupation of Archon Tau,
the Letnev fleet suffered a stunning defeat against Sol in
the Gral system. Only a few cycles after the battle, the Sol
Phoenix fleet entered the Xxlak system and engaged the
heavily fortified Letnev positions on Archon Tau. The
ensuing bombardments and battles lasted for almost two
years. In the end, the Letnev occupiers were defeated,
but with a terrible toll. The ecology of Archon Tau had
been shattered beyond recall. What was once a true
twin to the green and fruitful Archon Ren was now
a noxious, blackened crater. Its forests had burned.
Ashes and scattered dust started a planet-wide
winter that lasted for a hundred years, killing most
plant and animal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, recovered from the loss of Archon Tau,
the Xxcha kingdom has prospered on the generous
Archon Ren. Covered by mostly leafy forests, small
inland oceans, and fruitful jungles, Archon Ren is rich
in minerals, energy, foodstuffs, and water. The Xxcha
civilization dwells in a
myriad of arboreal villages
and towns. The only true
metropolis is the giant city of
Kklaj, found on the planet’s southern
hemisphere. Kklaj functions as the seat
of the Xxcha King, whose extensive palace, entirely sculpted
of Q’waar wood, and flower gardens, stretch for miles at the
center of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xxcha are an inherently peaceful, slow, and thoughtful
people. They hold their nobles and town elders in deep
respect. A common pastime of Xxcha males and females alike
is to debate meaning and origin while smoking gerr root on
long-stemmed pipes. The jungles and lakes of Archon Ren
are surprisingly free from the invasive insects that so often
make forest and jungle planets unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Xxcha still believe in the doctrine of
peace and negotiation, they will never again bend to
foreign invasion. Travelers to the Xxlak system will often
notice impressive sentinel Xxcha superdreadnoughts and
the distinctive Xxlun fighters in intense naval exercises.
Although the typical Xxcha may seem slow and encumbered
by a heavy reptilian bodily weight, when roused, the Xxcha
are surprisingly strong and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pale shadow of Archon Tau hangs like a scar in
the Xxcha skies. The sight of it is the everlasting sorrow
of the Xxcha, and the ever-present reminder of the cost of
submission. The Xxcha will never allow such tragedy to befall
them again. Ccrysus, the Xxcha King, knows that for the sake
of a peaceful galaxy, the Xxcha must seek the Imperial Throne
and be wise for all.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other players, including the Xxcha player, cannot use any &amp;ldquo;after another player activates a system that&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; abilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;During the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; supstep of a tactical action, the active player resolves the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; abilities of their units first. If the Xxcha player is not the active player, and the &lt;i&gt;Loncara Ssodu&lt;/i&gt; is destroyed by another player&amp;rsquo;s space cannon roll, it will not resolve its own &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The Xxcha player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Political Secret&lt;/i&gt; promissory note will prevent them from playing action cards or using their &lt;sc&gt;Quash&lt;/sc&gt; ability, but will not prevent them from voting.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Nekro player has the Xxcha player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, the Nekro player may vote, without losing their ability to predict outcomes for their &lt;sc&gt;Galactic Threat&lt;/sc&gt; faction ability.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;If the Xxcha player draws the &lt;i&gt;Covert Legislation&lt;/i&gt; agenda, they will only draw a hidden agenda if they choose to reveal it. If the Xxcha player is not the speaker, the speaker will view the hidden agenda, but the Xxcha player will not see it until it is either discarded from &lt;sc&gt;Quash&lt;/sc&gt;, or resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Xxcha player draws, reveals and resolves the &lt;i&gt;Miscount Disclosed&lt;/i&gt; agenda, they cast one vote for an outcome of the elected law, and resolve it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Xxcha player draws, reveals and resolves the &lt;i&gt;Public Execution&lt;/i&gt; agenda, the elected player may still vote in the agenda phase following the current action phase.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the Xxcha player chooses and reveals an agenda, they may then use their &lt;sc&gt;Quash&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After the Xxcha player chooses and reveals an agenda, they may play any rider action cards on the revealed agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Xxcha player chooses the order the two agendas are resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The two agendas are revealed before either is resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Xxcha player will resolve all abilities that trigger when or after an agenda is revealed for the first agenda before revealing the second agenda.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When an agenda outcome with an immediate effect resolves, all players resolve the effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an agenda would give multiple players a victory point, those players gain that victory point in initiative order, regardless of the Xxcha player&amp;rsquo;s initiative.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Other players may still perform one transaction total with the Xxcha player during this turn, if they are neighbors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Representative Government&lt;/i&gt; law is in play, it will have no effect on the Xxcha player as they resolve &lt;i&gt;Political Data Nexus&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a third law is put into play, the &lt;i&gt;Dictate Policy&lt;/i&gt; objective cannot be scored until the agenda phase.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Drive the Debate&lt;/i&gt; objective cannot be scored while resolving &lt;i&gt;Political Data Nexus&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Effects from agenda outcomes that occur &amp;ldquo;at the end of this agenda phase&amp;rdquo; are ignored.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Effects from agenda outcomes that occur &amp;ldquo;at the start of the next strategy phase&amp;rdquo; will still occur.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the status phase, public and secret objectives are scored simultaneously. The Xxcha player cannot score a public objective, unlock Xxekir Grom, and then use &lt;i&gt;Political Data Nexus &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; in order to score a secret objective, or vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The combined value may be spent as either influence or resources, not both, and cannot be split between the two.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Xxcha player owns a planet with three influence and three resources, they cannot score the &lt;i&gt;Amass Wealth&lt;/i&gt; objective by exhausting it and spending three trade goods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Political Data Nexus &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; only changes the spendable influence and resources. It does not change the value for any other game effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A space dock will not add the influence of the planet it is on to its &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;sc&gt; value.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The influence of a planet will not increase the number of units the Xxcha player may produce when using the &lt;i&gt;Integrated Economy&lt;/i&gt; technology.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The resources of the planets the Xxcha player controls will not contribute to unlocking Elder Qanoj.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Political Data Nexus &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; does not apply when scoring the &lt;i&gt;Establish Hegemony&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Hoard Raw Materials&lt;/i&gt; objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The Xxcha player will not add the influence of a planet when they gain trade goods with the &lt;i&gt;Mining Initiative&lt;/i&gt; action card. Other players will not add the influence when they gain trade goods from the &lt;i&gt;Uprising&lt;/i&gt; action card if they choose to exhaust one of the Xxcha player&amp;rsquo;s planets.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The resource value of a planet will be added to its influence value when the Xxcha player casts votes during the agenda phase.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;During the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; supstep of a tactical action, the active player resolves the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; abilities of their units first. If the Xxcha player is not the active player, and their ships are removed by another player&amp;rsquo;s space cannon roll, they must immediately remove units to meet their capacity limit. They will not resolve the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; abilities of any of their removed mechs.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Defense&lt;/b&gt; substep of a tactical action, only non&amp;ndash;active players can use the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability of their units.

loss, he was intent on finding a cure for this horrible affliction,
and refused to let any law stay his hand. In silent revenge
against the destiny of his children, he left his employment with
the prestigious Hospitaler Clinic in New Moscow and traveled
to the third moon of Emelpar, where he secretly sought and
finally acquired ancient Mahact bio studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brilliant Darien made great advances in the following
years. His wife Moyin contributed the embryos he needed
for his forbidden experiments. With his successes, however,
word of his work began to leak, and a congregation of the
hopeful began to surround him, bringing their sick and dying
to his care, clinging to a last hope that his discoveries could
cure them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darien’s secret ended the day a sick child died in his care.
The anguished, remorseful parents blamed Darien for the
death and contacted the Sol authorities. That night, Darien fled
Jord with his wife and a few of his most devout followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a known fugitive, Darien narrowly escaped capture
again and again. To finally escape the Lazax authorities, his
small group joined religious colonists migrating to a new home
on the remote planet of Lael, a place of harsh oceans and stormy
climates. Their fugitive years brought healing and perspective
on the death of their children, and Darien and Moyin found
happiness again on the windy plains of Lael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a few years later, Moyin developed Greyfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desperate to save his wife, Darien employed all his skills
and forbidden knowledge, but still he failed. Before her death,
he extracted a single egg from her womb—preserving the
genetic blueprint of her unborn children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He burned her body on the summit of the Hills of Grace,
which they had named after their lost daughter. As Moyin’s
ashes drifted upwards into the strong winds, Darien dug a
stone out of the hillside with his bare hands and placed it
near the fire. That stone was to become part of the foundation
for the great monastery of Lucas, named after Darien and
Moyin’s lost son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following decades, Darien was able to produce a
child from a clone of Moyin’s egg and his own seed. It was a
boy. Cloning Moyin’s egg by the thousands, producing child
after child with increasing success, Darien became a master of
the forbidden craft. Yet, inexplicably to him, all the children
were boys, and he was never able to eradicate the vulnerability
to Greyfire from his creation. Though he was able to eliminate
the lethal outcome of the disease in his “sons” as he called
them, the Greyfire would attack their skins and topical tissues,
hideously deforming most of the children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Darien’s death, his
sons diligently continued his
work. They continued cloning
Moyin’s egg, which they called
the “Yin,” and they continued the
production of new “brothers” from their
own seed. Over the centuries, the monastery of Lucas became
a vast facility, completely covering the Hills of Grace and the
surrounding plains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brotherhood, blessed with the brilliant minds of both
Darien and Moyin, grew to vast proportions and renamed
their planet “Darien.” As the Age of Dusk neared its end, the
Brotherhood ventured into space, establishing monasteries on
Darien’s moons and its surrounding systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brotherhood long ago abandoned any hope of a female
creation, and instead worship the Yin as the mother and the
feminine in their lives. Despite centuries of continued work,
they have never been able to completely eradicate the signs
of Greyfire. Instead, the brothers that are completely ravaged
and deformed by the disease are revered as “The Blessed,”
and the brothers left untouched by the disease are called “The
Untouched.” The Blessed form the inner elders and councilors
of the Yin society. The Untouched are trained as ambassadors
to the other races and as elite soldiers of the Brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their flesh, the brothers carry the secret inner fire and
rebellious ambition of Darien. The oldest of the Blessed,
the Elder Brother, intimately understands the emotions
and aspirations of all his brothers. Intent and unified, the
Brotherhood now builds a vast fleet with which to bring
Darien’s legacy and the light of Yin to the imperial throne itself.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;h1&gt;Indoctrination&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;sc&gt;Indoctrination&lt;/sc&gt; is limited to once per ground combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an invasion involves ground combats on multiple planets, &lt;sc&gt;Indoctrination&lt;/sc&gt; may be used at the start of each of them.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Yin player&amp;rsquo;s opponent only has mechs in the ground combat, &lt;sc&gt;Indoctrination&lt;/sc&gt; cannot be used.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Yin player is in a combat with the Naalu player, and the Naalu player is using the ability of their flagship, the &lt;i&gt;Matriarch&lt;/i&gt;, to commit only fighters to the ground combat, &lt;sc&gt;Indoctrination&lt;/sc&gt; cannot be used.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the last of a player&amp;rsquo;s ground forces in a ground combat are removed by &lt;sc&gt;Indoctrination&lt;/sc&gt;, that player loses the combat immediately. They will be unable to use any &amp;ldquo;start of combat&amp;rdquo; abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Devotion&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When resolving &lt;sc&gt;Devotion&lt;/sc&gt;, the Yin player chooses which ship is assigned the hit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The Yin cannot choose their own ships as targets.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The targeted ship may cancel the hit with its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability, if present. Other ships with the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability cannot cancel the hit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Shields Holding&lt;/i&gt; action card may be used to cancel the hit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player retreats, the Yin player will be unable to use &lt;sc&gt;Devotion&lt;/sc&gt; to destroy an opponent&amp;rsquo;s ship.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Yin player is in a combat with the N&amp;rsquo;orr player, then the two players will alternate when resolving end of combat round abilities, starting with the attacker.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Greyfire Mutagen &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Leader abilities, mech abilities and flagship abilities are not faction abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Greyfire Mutagen &amp;Omega; &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may receive &lt;i&gt;Greyfire Mutagen &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; in a transaction during a ground combat. If received at the start of ground combat, that player may play it immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A transaction must involve the active player. As such, the defender will be unable to receive &lt;i&gt;Greyfire Mutagen &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive &lt;i&gt;Greyfire Mutagen &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; more than once per turn.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the active player received &lt;i&gt;Greyfire Mutagen &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Yin player to regain it. However, &lt;i&gt;Greyfire Mutagen &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play &lt;i&gt;Greyfire Mutagen &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; again during the same ground combat.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If an invasion involves ground combat on multiple planets, &lt;i&gt;Greyfire Mutagen &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt; may be played at the start of each of them.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Impulse Core &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When resolving &lt;i&gt;Impulse Core&lt;/i&gt;, the Yin player&amp;rsquo;s opponent chooses which ship is assigned the hit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Effects that cancel hits, such as the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability, may be used to cancel a hit produced by &lt;i&gt;Impulse Core&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Impulse Core&lt;/i&gt; will resolve before the &lt;b&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/b&gt; step of a space combat. As such, any destroyed destroyers will not make an anti&amp;ndash;fighter barrage roll.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Yin Spinner &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The infantry may be placed on a planet that does not contain a unit with &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Other effects that produce units without a unit using its &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability will not trigger &lt;i&gt;Yin Spinner&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Yin Spinner &amp;Omega; &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The two infantry must be placed together.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Other effects that produce units without a unit using its &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability will trigger &lt;i&gt;Yin Spinner &amp;Omega;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Van Hauge &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When the &lt;i&gt;Van Hauge&lt;/i&gt; is destroyed, it will not destroy any of the Saar player&amp;rsquo;s Floating Factories present in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Van Hauge&lt;/i&gt; will not destroy ground forces in the system. However, each player must then remove ground forces, if necessary, from the space area of that system to meet capacity limits.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;As both players will have zero ships in the active system after the Van Hauge is destroyed, the combat will end in a draw.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Brother Milor &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If all of a player&amp;rsquo;s ships are destroyed during combat, they may still place ships with this ability. If they do, combat will continue.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If that player&amp;rsquo;s opponent has no ships remaining, that player will instead win that combat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Capacity is not checked during combat. As such a player may use Brother Milor to place fighters into a space combat where they have no spare capacity. After that combat ends, that player must remove fighters and/or ground forces to meet their capacity limit in that system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Yin player uses Brother Milor after the &lt;i&gt;Van Hauge&lt;/i&gt; is destroyed during a space combat, they will win that combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If all ships in the system are destroyed, and there are excess hits that have not been assigned to a ship, those hits will lapse, and cannot be assigned to the newly placed fighters.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a ship uses its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability, and is then destroyed by a &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card, then any remaining hits may be assigned to any placed fighters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If all ships in the system are destroyed by hits produced from a space cannon roll, the player that produced those hits may score the &lt;i&gt;Turn Their Fleets to Dust&lt;/i&gt; secret objective before the new fighters are placed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Brother Milor &amp;Omega; &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Brother Milor &amp;Omega; may only be used during the action phase.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If all of a player&amp;rsquo;s units are destroyed during combat, they may still place units with this ability. If they do, combat will continue.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If that player&amp;rsquo;s opponent has no units remaining, that player will instead win that combat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Capacity is not checked during combat. As such a player may use Brother Milor &amp;Omega; to place fighters into a space combat where they have no spare capacity. After that combat ends, that player must remove fighters and/or ground forces to meet their capacity limit in that system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Yin player uses Brother Milor &amp;Omega; after the &lt;i&gt;Van Hauge&lt;/i&gt; is destroyed during a space combat, they will win that combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If all units in the combat are destroyed, and there are excess hits that have not been assigned to a unit, those hits will lapse, and cannot be assigned to the newly placed units.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a ship uses its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability, and is then destroyed by a &lt;i&gt;Direct Hit&lt;/i&gt; action card, then any remaining hits may be assigned to any placed fighters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If all ships in the system are destroyed by hits produced from a space cannon roll, the player that produced those hits may score the &lt;i&gt;Turn Their Fleets to Dust&lt;/i&gt; secret objective before the new fighters are placed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If all ground forces on a planet are destroyed by hits produced from a bombardment roll, the player that produced those hits may score the &lt;i&gt;Make an Example of Their World&lt;/i&gt; secret objective before the new infantry are placed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Yin player uses Brother Milor &amp;Omega; when a unit is destroyed that is both a ground force and a ship due to some game effect, that unit&amp;rsquo;s owner may place two fighters or two infantry.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If placed this way during a space combat, any newly placed infantry cannot participate. If placed this way during a ground combat, any newly placed fighters cannot participate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Brother Omar &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;i&gt;Regulated Conscription&lt;/i&gt; law is in play, the Yin player may produce two infantry for one resource. This will count one towards their &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; limit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a game effect instructs the Yin player to produce units without using the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability, they may only produce infantry if that game effect allows them to produce infantry.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Yin player may choose to produce one infantry for one resource. If they do, they may produce one additional infantry.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Brother Omar &amp;Omega; &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The faction abilities to unlock Brother Omar are &lt;sc&gt;Indoctrination&lt;/sc&gt; or &lt;sc&gt;Devotion&lt;/sc&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If another player owns a faction specific unit upgrade, it cannot be chosen in order to gain the generic version of that unit upgrade by using Brother Omar.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If another player has the Yin player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note, they cannot use it to research a faction specific unit upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dannel of the Tenth &amp;mdash; Spinner Overdrive &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Yin player may ready a planet they control containing zero infantry.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Dannel of the Tenth &amp;Omega; &amp;mdash; Quantum Dissemination &amp;Omega; &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A total of three infantry may be placed. These may all be placed on one planet, or placed one each on three planets, or split two/one between two planets.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Only the &lt;b&gt;Commit Ground Forces&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Ground Combat&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Establish Control&lt;/b&gt; steps of an invasion are resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Yin player commits all infantry before resolving any combats.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only the three infantry from the Yin player&amp;rsquo;s reinforcements may be committed during the &lt;b&gt;Commit Ground Forces&lt;/b&gt; step. Ground forces in the space area above the planets cannot be committed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Yin player may use their &lt;sc&gt;Indoctrination&lt;/sc&gt; ability and their mech&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Yin player does not activate the systems containing the planets that they are committing infantry to. As such, any effects that trigger &amp;ldquo;when/after a player activates a system&amp;rdquo; do not trigger.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Parley&lt;/i&gt; action card may be used on one planet when the Yin player resolves &lt;i&gt;Quantum Dissemination&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Yin player has no ships with capacity in the planet&amp;rsquo;s system, then the infantry will be removed from the board.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Yin player does have ships with capacity in the planet&amp;rsquo;s system, then the infantry will be placed in the space area of the system. The Yin player might then need to remove infantry and/or fighters from the system to satisfy the capacity limit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Moyin&amp;rsquo;s Ashes &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A &lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt; ability may only be resolved for units in a player&amp;rsquo;s reinforcements. If all four Moyin&amp;rsquo;s Ashes are already on the board, no more may be deployed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a Moyin&amp;rsquo;s Ashes is destroyed during combat, another may be deployed in a later combat during the same invasion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The removed unit must still be an infantry.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt; ability has a total cost of three influence. The Yin player may exhaust a single planet with three or more influence to pay this cost.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Near the Mahact Plateau, diagonally opposite the Passage
of Tears, but located in a far richer area of the region, shines
the Myock star and its two habitable planets, Shalloq and
Retillion. As recorded in even the earliest annals, Retillion
has been known for the edible and delicious menn root.
Throughout the Lazax Imperium, many farming colonies
existed on Retillion, harvesting the roots along the musky
and odorous shores of the Fianni swamps. In the years of
Lazax emperor Munhan Las Idu, the colonization efforts were
dramatically expanded. Not long after the start of the farming
expansion, however, things started to go terribly wrong on
Retillion: farm machines were sabotaged, isolated farms
destroyed, inhabitants murdered by an unseen foe that would
strike when the bog mists rolled over the lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The empire sent reinforcements, and the colonists soon
realized that they were under systematic attack by a small
native chameleon race with natural greenish skin and large
yellow lamp-like eyes. These aborigines had the ability to
“fade,” making them both virtually invisible to the naked
eye and a great threat to the farming boom towns springing
up along the edges of the measureless swamps. It was clear
that the natives were a primitive race, but fierce, intelligent,
and relentless in their intent to stop the invasive farming of
their native swamplands. From the few early prisoners, it was
learned that they called themselves the “Yssaril” and that a
vast network of villages and tribes was to be found in the
continent-sized Fianni swamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eager to renew the supplies of their beloved menn
root, the Lazax sent their 21st Expeditionary Division to
suppress the Yssaril uprising, allowing for the resumption
of the increased farming mandate. During these bloody
years, thousands of Yssaril were captured and shipped to
governments and buyers across the galaxy for study or
hunting sports. Although farming did resume, the Lazax
military division never completely suppressed the Yssaril
natives. As the small green Yssaril adapted to the Lazax style
of warfare, as they stole and learned to use Lazax weapons,
the Fianni swamp soon became an embarrassing killing field
for Lazax conscripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during the Age of Dusk that the great races learned
to utilize the potential of the intelligent Yssaril as spies
and assassins for their covert operations. For a hundred
years, the Yssaril learned the skills of stealth, the
usage of technologies, and the power of information.
Combined with their own natural ability to become
nearly invisible, they soon came to realize their own
potential and established the powerful and feared
Guild of Spies. By the proceeds derived from Guild
business, the Yssaril added a formidable income
source to their civilization and to the development
of Retillion. With this power and influence, they were
able to convince the Lazax to leave the planet (while still
supplying menn root). Over a few generations, the Yssaril
became industrial, educated, and ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although still powerful
in covert circles, the Guild
now functions as the prime
governing body of the united
Yssaril tribes. The Guild elects
its leader from its faction of master
assassins. This prime leader, the Cqaark, leads the powerful
civilization of an intelligent, determined, and ambitious
people: a people whose history has left them with little love
for the other great races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Lazax left, no off-worlders have been allowed
on Retillion. The Yssaril capital Wuecca lies somewhere
deep in the Fianni swamps, its actual location unknown to
all but the Yssaril. The official business, trade, and covert
operations are conducted from the planet Shalloq, which the
Yssaril colonized not long after gaining independence from
the Lazax. The only actual Yssaril city known to off-worlders
is the city of Mojeb on Shalloq. From here, or from Shalloq’s
great orbital trade station Haarsuh, the Yssaril receive foreign
emissaries, merchants, and visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proud, fierce Yssaril are slowly starting to look
beyond their borders and beyond the income of the Guild.
Hidden in the planetary shadow of Shalloq, and kept secret
from the rest of the galaxy by the covert means at which the
Yssaril excel, a great invasion fleet is being built. Although
the rest of the galaxy may shudder at the Yssaril’s unseen eyes
and ears, it would be terrified if it knew the ruthless imperial
ambitions of the small green people.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

    <value>&lt;h1&gt;Stall Tactics&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Scheming&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;No other abilities may resolve until the Yssaril player has discarded the action card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;sc&gt;Scheming&lt;/sc&gt; applies whenever the Yssaril player draws action cards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Yssaril player will draw only one additional action card, regardless of how many action cards they are instructed to draw.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The discarded action card may be any card in the Yssaril player&amp;rsquo;s hand; it does not have to be one of the cards they just drew.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Effects that give the Yssaril player action cards without drawing them, such as &lt;i&gt;The Codex&lt;/i&gt; relic or the &lt;i&gt;Reverse Engineer&lt;/i&gt; action card, will not trigger &lt;sc&gt;Scheming&lt;/sc&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Crafty&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The effect of the &lt;i&gt;Executive Sanctions&lt;/i&gt; law does not affect the Yssaril player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Spy Net &lt;sub&gt;(Promissory Note)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The player that plays &lt;i&gt;Spy Net&lt;/i&gt; must look at the Yssaril player&amp;rsquo;s hand of action cards. They do not have to read or memorize what they look at.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may receive &lt;i&gt;Spy Net&lt;/i&gt; in a transaction during their turn. If received at the start of that player&amp;rsquo;s turn, that player may play it immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The active player may perform a transaction with each other player at most once per turn. As such, the active player cannot receive &lt;i&gt;Spy Net&lt;/i&gt; more than once per turn.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the active player received &lt;i&gt;Spy Net&lt;/i&gt; on a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Yssaril player to regain it. However, &lt;i&gt;Spy Net&lt;/i&gt; cannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot play &lt;i&gt;Spy Net&lt;/i&gt; again until their next turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any deal between the Yssaril player and another player regarding which action card will be chosen, if made before &lt;i&gt;Spy Net&lt;/i&gt; is exchanged, is non&amp;ndash;binding.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Mageon Implants &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When resolving &lt;i&gt;Mageon Implants&lt;/i&gt;, the Yssaril player is not drawing a card. As such, &lt;sc&gt;Scheming&lt;/sc&gt; will not trigger.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Yssaril player must target a player with at least one action card in their hand when they resolve &lt;i&gt;Mageon Implants&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Transparasteel Plating &lt;sub&gt;(Technology)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Other players may resolve faction abilities, leader abilities or technology abilities during the Yssaril player&amp;rsquo;s turns.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Y&amp;rsquo;sia Y&amp;rsquo;ssrila &lt;sub&gt;(Flagship)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Yssaril player owns the &lt;i&gt;Light/Wave Deflector&lt;/i&gt; technology, it will have no additional effect on the &lt;i&gt;Y&amp;rsquo;sia Y&amp;rsquo;ssrila&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ssruu &lt;sub&gt;(Agent)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Yssaril player duplicates an agent that allows a unit to roll an additional die, and both the duplicated agent and Ssruu target the same unit, that unit will roll two additional dice.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Yssaril player duplicates the Saar player&amp;rsquo;s Captain Mendosa agent, they may do so before or after other effects are used to modify any ship&amp;rsquo;s move value. This includes the Saar player&amp;rsquo;s Captain Mendosa agent effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If both the Yssaril player and the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith player wish to target the same player with the Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith The Stillness of Stars agent ability, then they will both be able to capture a ship, resolving in initiative order from the active player. Both players will still use the target player&amp;rsquo;s full commodity value to determine which units they may capture. Should the first player to resolve capture the last of a type of unit from the target player&amp;rsquo;s reinforcements, the latter player cannot capture a unit of the same type.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Yssaril player duplicates the Mentak player&amp;rsquo;s Suffi An agent, then the Yssaril player and the player targeted by the Mentak player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Pillage&lt;/sc&gt; ability will draw action cards. The Mentak player will not.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Duplicating the effect of the Argent player&amp;rsquo;s Trillossa Aun Mirik agent, the Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s Emissary Taivra agent or the Jol&amp;ndash;Nar player&amp;rsquo;s Doctor Sucaban agent during the same timing window as that agent is used will have no additional effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If either the Yssaril player or the Nomad player resolve the effect of the Nomad player&amp;rsquo;s The Thundarian agent, the other will be unable to resolve the same effect immediately. They must wait until dice are rolled again before they may resolve the effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;For notes about an agent of a specific faction, see that faction&amp;rsquo;s notes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;So Ata &lt;sub&gt;(Commander)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Yssaril player cannot unlock So Ata if they are yet to discard a card for their &lt;sc&gt;Scheming&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Kyver, Blade and Key &amp;mdash; Guild of Spies &lt;sub&gt;(Hero)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each other player chooses which action card they show the Yssaril player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Taking action cards from a player using &lt;i&gt;Guild of Spies&lt;/i&gt; will not trigger the Yssaril player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Scheming&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Blackshade Infiltrator &lt;sub&gt;(Mech)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;The Mahact were not the first great galactic empire, nor will the Lazax be the last, so say the Zealots of Rhodun and their annals. A religious order who now dwell among the placid orbits of the Orad system, the Zealots claim to be an ancient group who have inherited and are sworn to protect the technological secrets of ancient great powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Rhodun first came to the Orad system, in a time when few species had yet traveled between the stars, it was in religious pilgrimage, acting on guidance from their forebears. If the Rhodun keep record of their original home (as they almost surely do), the information has not been shared with outsiders. This is not atypical, however, as to say that the Rhodun closely guard their knowledge would be a severe understatement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zealots dwell primarily on Orad III, known simply as "Orad", eponymous with the system. On Orad the Rhodun live a highly ritualized and ordered life, with religious officials of varying ranks managing high-level affairs, and with mundane or labor-intensive tasks being carried out by the Plac, the less advanced indigenous inhabitants of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poh, the other habitable planet in the system, and the destination for the original Rhodun pilgrimage, is now a nearly-deserted Temple world, a place where only the High Zealots may tread. Poh’s lonely spires and sprawling temple complexes are home, it is said, to many of the Zealots of Rhodun’s most closely-held secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zealots themselves are relatively few, compared to the populations of other great factions across the galaxy, and they have traditionally preferred to take a quiet role in galactic affairs, shepherding their secrets and only engaging in wider conflict when they believe that a group is misusing the gifts of the ancients —so they call their technological mysteries. The Zealots believe, and certainly claim, that the vast majority of all technological advancement that occurs across the galaxy is inspired by their progenitors, and that in fact their order is directly descended from the group that the ancients trained for the task of safeguarding their gifts, and protecting the same from misuse and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zealots’ use of the arcane technology is foundational to their blind faith; they do not understand the tools they have except as far as ancient rituals guide them in their use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zealots interaction with outsiders is characteristically aggressive, dismissive, and imperious. To the Zealots, only the Rhodun, and those they deem so, are worthy of inheriting the great secrets of their progenitors. Time and again the Zealots have observed other groups misuse technology to the wrong ends, causing strife and turmoil. By intervening when others come close to achieving calamity, the Zealots believe that they are protecting their lesser peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the internal affairs of the Rhodun are similarly strict, rigid, and unforgiving. The succession of ranks of the Zealots’ priestesses are highly ritualized, and only those who excel may climb before their time. The highest ranking of their people, known simply as the Prophet, maintains near total control over Rhodun society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the Zealots may have had a distaste for the wider affairs of the galaxy in the past, the order has more recently begun to shift in new directions. There have been rumors that the Prophet is readying for a new pilgrimage, one that will take the Rhodun out of their placid watchfulness and toward the imperial throne.&lt;/p&gt;</value>

  <data name="TheZelianPurifier_Lore" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;In the final throes of the Twilight wars, explorers discovered a strange phenomenon on a planet in the outer reaches. What they had uncovered was a pulsating crystal, which seemed to be quantumly linked to similar crystals across the planet. Hoping to discover new potential secrets which would help with the impending threats back home, a select group of scientists was dispatched to examine the site and exhume its secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first the scientists noticed that tiny rocks would move and float around these strange crystals. Then a more important discovery appeared, the infinite potential of these cold crystals to store energy. What followed was study after study, and experiment after experiment, but all failed to produce a reliable method of releasing the stored energy before they were recalled with the onset of the Dark Years. The researchers did not realize the most critical discovery until reviewing their data upon returning to friendly space, that these crystals were sentient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some time during the Dark Years, a portion of the planet broke off and hurled into its moon, Gen. To the primitive life on the planet, this was the herald of their eventual demise. The seeding of Zelian crystals into the mantle of Gen would sap all heat from the core over thousands of years, eventually destroying the magnetosphere and thus stripping the atmosphere. Some accounts of the apocalyptic last years survived in tablets from one of the doomed civilizations, recounting the strange phenomena of the times before their abrupt and mysterious disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, visitors to the Zelian system have been encouraged to power down all essential systems while passing through. Less cautious vessels have been found, torn to pieces by apparent asteroid collisions. Upon the return of the Mahact, a small asteroid exhibiting a strange propulsion signature arrived in the Mecatol system ahead of a meeting of the Galactic Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the on-board data crystal had been deciphered it was quickly brought to the Council. Contained within was an extensive account of torture administered by an unknown perpetrator. Each cult expressed the agony of Zelian, and the horrors it had endured. The end of the closing statement, was simply a demand to “give up the guilty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lengthy recess of the Council to address these findings and the concluding demand, the reconvened Council expressed its heartfelt concern at these cruel experiments. Sadly, they claimed, they possessed no information which would benefit Zelian in its crusade. Today, Zelian maintains a presence before the council, begrudgingly participating in intragalactic politics. Zelian remains all too aware that, were it seated on the throne, those who had wronged it could hide no longer.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
