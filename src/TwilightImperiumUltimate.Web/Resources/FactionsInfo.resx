    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Not far past the Unicorn Nebula, the golden
Sardakk star shines its ancient, hot light on giant
oceanless Quinarra. The massive planet radiates a red
glow like a dusty ruby in the night, its massive polar
storms clearly visible from space. A great network of
orbital space stations and massive complements of fleet
units occupy the system in the fashion of the insectile
N’orr. Massive whale-like N’orr carriers spew fighters
like angry hornets from a disturbed nest. Convoys of
ice-mountain transports are always inbound from the
planet Tren’lak. Small spider-like robotic ships drill
into the sides of the ice, guiding the ice to the orbital
liquid-processing plants, after which the derived water
and salt is flown to Quinarra by bloated sungliders
that, like beetle balloons, slowly descend to the N’orr
cities below.
Quinarra itself is among the most inhospitable
of planets inhabited by a major civilization. Only
Letnev’s Arc Prime is recognized as more desolate than
Quinarra. The Letnev, however, live exclusively under
Arc Prime’s surface, whereas the N’orr civilization is well
established both on and below Quinarra’s continents.
Only Quinarra’s polar regions, where even the hardy
N’orr cannot survive the deadly storms for extended
periods of time, are largely uninhabited. Brutal electric,
hail, and dust storms, although not approaching the
ferocity of the polar storms, are frequent throughout
the planet and considered normal by the N’orr.
Visitors to Quinarra will be flown directly
to the immigration nexus in the capital H’cor. If
weather permits sufficient visibility, most visitors
will be impressed by the massive size and explosive
traffic of the city. The N’orr structures are typically
oval or rounded, created from a hardened reddish
material similar to the general topography of the
planet. Like most major N’orr cities, H’cor features
towering building constructs, sprawling low-story
buildings, and deep gorges that reveal city-nests
deep below the surface, delving into the red
earth. Busy roads and hover-lanes cross the
city in a thousand ways, often congested with
N’orr traffic.
The N’orr will tell you
that they are ruled by “Sardakk
the Queen Mother,” but that
acknowledgment seems more
steeped in ritual than fact. None have
ever met the mythical “mother,” and no off-world
documentation exists suggesting there is any truth to
the notion. The accepted and visible head of the N’orr
state is the Envoy of the Queen, a male N’orr in direct
command of the cultural, economic, and military
matters of the race. The length of the Envoy’s tenure
and the process of his election seems to be decided by
a secret brotherhood, the “Veiled Brood,” in which lies
the real power of the N’orr.
The Envoy and the Veiled Brood oversee the rapid
expansion of the N’orr military forces and fleets. The
Tekklar Elite soldiers are the pride of their people. The
Tekklar train exclusively in the southern polar regions,
where the weak die and the strong become G’hom:
members of the prestigious Tekklar order, treated like
knights by the N’orr and feared across the galaxy. As
Quinarra slowly turns, as the stars again come into
their right constellations, the Veiled Brood knows that
the time to swarm is coming again. And this time, the
swarm will cover the stars.</value>

  <data name="TheArborec_History" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>On first approach to Nestphar, a first-time visitor may
be surprised by the soupy haze that bleeds from the planet’s
atmosphere like a dusty cloud. This cloud consists of
quadrillions of tiny living spores emitted by Nestphar’s many
Flaah, city-sized floating forests in its stratosphere. The shortlived (and therefore continually resupplied) orbital presence
of the Flaah spores allows the Arborec denizens in Nestphar’s
space-stations and shipyards to remain in continuous
symbiotic contact with their planet. The Arborec term for this
vital connection, shared among all living things on Nestphar, is
best translated as “the Symphony.”
When traveling beyond the reach of Nestphar’s Flaah spores,
and therefore outside connection to the prime Symphony, the
Arborec employ the massive Letani. Physically, the Letani are
the largest sentient beings yet discovered in the galaxy (each
slightly larger than a Sol Elephantus), their bodies resembling
a kraken-shaped mushroom crossed with a monstrous
carnivorous flower. The Letani are each uniquely capable of
embodying a powerful instance of the Symphony (and are
therefore closest to an “individual” within Arborec society)
which may act as a harmonic nexus for Arborec organisms
in near proximity. All ships in the Arborec fleet are based
around the presence of at least one (with some ships as many
as five) Letani orchestrating the unity of Arborec lifeforms
crewing the vessel. Once a Letani returns to the embrace of
Nestphar’s prime Symphony, its experiences are reconnected
and absorbed into the Arborec, as a data-capsule would be
reconnected to its mainframe.
While surely intelligent and demonstrably capable
of crafting impressive technologies, structures, and a
sophisticated fleet of interstellar craft, the Arborec’s method
of communication remains a source of great controversy.
Being a race of vegetative and fungal matter, handling its own
data transmission and emotive projection through the prime
Symphony, the Arborec have never developed any form of
visual or auditory communication (concepts which, to this
day, remain foreign to them).
Arborec scientists found the solution to this dilemma in the
Sol merchant vessel Dies Opulen. The crew of the Dies Opulen
had tragically become infected by Yborin Plague on Maaluk
and had later died in deep space. When the derelict ship was
found by an Arborec scout, it was determined the cool bodies
of the human crew were in perfect condition for an ambitious
experiment. The bodies were sent to the great laboratories in
Kushin, near the Arborec capital Phara.
Here, fungal Arzuga cells were attached to the brainstems
of the dead humans. It was hoped, when grown under proper
conditions, the complex acidic properties of Arzuga would
successfully merge the cells with the innate brain-tissue of the
deceased subjects, slowly re-stimulating the neural pathways
back to life. Then, by injecting photo-voltaic stims into the
soft tissues of the dead body, the neurally active Arzuga
would spur the soft tissue cells to heal and regrow, effectively
reanimating the dead body. Symbiotically attached to the
host body, the Arzuga
fungi evolved into a new
being, one which the Arborec
call the Dirzuga.
The Dirzuga were the missing
link between the Symphony and the
manifestation of physical communication that the Arborec
lacked. Over the following few decades, the Arborec eagerly
acquired additional subjects (human bodies seem to work best
and are the most frequently used, but Letnev, Winnu, and Xxcha
bodies are also commonly used as Dirzuga hosts), establishing a
sizable diplomatic and trading corps that have become the basis
for the Arborec’s interaction with the rest of the galaxy.
The Arborec insist the host bodies of the Dirzuga are
devoid of the expired individuals’ consciousness. With a
cultural relationship to death rooted in the natural cycle
of decomposition and regrowth, the Arborec have little
understanding or sympathy for those who vigorously protest
against the bodies of their citizens being reused (some use the
term “enslaved”) in such a manner.
Ultimately, despite the objections of the dissident races, the
Arborec were admitted as a member of the galactic council. The
potential wealth of foodstuffs, medicines, and other treasures
of Nestphar proved effective in overcoming any objections.
While the Arborec insist that the past knowledge and
experiences of Dirzuga bodies do not persist beyond this
reanimation, there are some who suspect the Arborec do not
tell the entire truth. Such theorists can provide many examples
in which the Arborec seem to have come upon information,
or intimate understanding of other cultures, that seem
inexplicable otherwise.</value>

    <value>o. Few alive today have dealings with the Shikrai. This collection of related avian subspecies lives scattered across a stretch of the galactic rim. Their clutch of worlds are dry, windswept, and poor, lacking in valuable resources or useful minerals. Their small and technologically backward populations tend to stay out of galactic affairs. Most rightfully dismiss the Shikrai as just one more group of sentients in a galaxy full of life. But there is more to the Shikrai than the rest of the galaxy, or even themselves, realize. Long ago, Shikrai territory had the misfortune of being the disputed vassalage of two powerful Mahact. These genesorcerers fought a vicious internecine war for the avians’ planets, with the Shikrai forced to fight as proxies on both sides. Shikrai partisans fought back as best they could, but they had no hope of defeating the armies of two gene-sorcerers. There was no doubt the Shikrai would be consumed by the fight to claim them…until a Lazax battlegroup arrived. A Lazax warlord named Harkor Ilban Tal liberated the Shikrai and personally slew both gene-sorcerers in single combat. To pay their debt, the remaining Shikrai immediately allied with Tal. Eventually, when the Mahact were exiled beyond the Acheron Gate, the Shikrai made a pledge to their allies. They would contribute a tithe of their best warriors and scholars to found an organization that would watch Acheron and ensure the Mahact would never return. They would call it the Argent Flight. To do so, the Shikrai turned to their ancestral homeworlds of Valk, Avar, and Ylir, which they had abandoned long ago when they set out to colonize the stars. The Lazax erased all mention of the worlds from their newly constructed Hall of Cartography, and the newly founded Argent Flight retreated to their sanctuary to wait…and prepare. Valk, Avar, and Ylir are curiosities even in a galaxy full of wonders. The three worlds are barely larger than moons, and share a narrow orbit between the neutron star Phorus and the gas giant Hacid. The unique environment created the Atharal Gas Torus—a ring of breathable air in orbit around Phorus. The three worlds orbit in the center of the ring, and the Shikrai say their winged ancestors used to fly from world to world. In the millennia since their return, the Argent Flight has worked hard to colonize the three worlds and the smaller chunks of rock that drift between them. Numerous flocks of Shikrai live throughout the torus. Each flock focuses on a different trade or calling, and any member of the Argent Flight can join or leave a flock as they choose. Their actions are coordinated by the Murmeration, a council of representatives from each flock who direct the Argent Flight from their spindle tower sanctuary on Avar. The Murmeration continues to quietly recruit promising members from the various Shikrai worlds, though the population of the Atharal Torus is now large enough to be selfsustaining. It has also developed beyond simply a martial order into a fully functional society. Large-bellied cloud-scoops dive into the atmosphere of Hacid to gather rare gases that can be refined into industrial compounds, while the cometminers of the outer system keep the Atharal Torus well-supplied in fresh water. The Argent Flight has even genecrafted the massive, zero-gravity trees that live free-floating in the Torus so that they grow edible fruits, and has built mechanical grav-wings so that its members can soar from planet to planet once more. However, the Argent Flight still remembers its sworn oaths. Millennia of service have seen its duty evolve into something akin to a religion, and the Shikrai see themselves as sacred guardians appointed by the galaxy’s rightful rulers. The various flocks never revealed themselves to the wider galaxy during the Twilight Wars. Instead they fought their own battles in the shadows against the Mahact’s sleeper agents and greedy explorers who ventured too deeply into Shaleri Space. And they succeeded in their task until a new race, the Creuss, sent an expedition past the Tolari Pulsar too large to defeat in combat. In the aftermath of the Mahact’s awakening, the Argent Flight has begun to gather its forces. The Murmeration is in accord; the time for secrecy is past. Already, agents move amongst the Shikrai worlds, calling worthy fighters to take the vows of the Flight. In the open-air ship docks of the Atharal Torus, master shipwrights have laid down the keels of sleek, gull-winged destroyers. The Argent Flight knows, now that its ancient nemesis has returned, that it has no choice—it must lead the rest of the galaxy on a holy crusade to finish what the Lazax started so long ago.</value>

    <value>In the very blackness of space lies cold, hard Arc
Prime. Its system has no central star, and Arc Prime’s
lack of defined orbit has been a mystery to scientists for
millennia. It is a common jest that Arc Prime is simply
afloat in space, and that only the Letnev disdain for
the rest of the galaxy protects it from a fatal collision.
The Letnev’s principal vassal, Wren Terra, shines like a
mighty star in the ebon distance, while thorny military
ships surround the dark planet like fireflies attracted to
a black hole.
Foreign visitors to Arc Prime will, under heavy fighter
escort, be directed to the Dunlain Crater. The crater holds
the sprawling city of Feruc, Arc Prime’s only city located
on the planetary surface. Feruc is a pressurized mesh of
icy black metal housing, belching industries, warehouses,
and military installations. The thin atmosphere of Arc
Prime prohibits normal surface life outside the cold
pressurized facilities of Feruc. Since the Barony has no
use for the meager atmosphere of Arc Prime, it freely
emits unfiltered pollutants from the underground Letnev
cities and factories to the surface. A journey to Feruc is
likely to leave a thick layer of frozen black residue on any
vessel. It is a common merchant endearment to call a ship
returning from Arc Prime a “Chimney Sweeper.”
Under the surface of Arc Prime, heated by its
planetary core, the Baron presides over the proud and
fierce Letnev people. Few non-natives have ever visited
the capital Goz, fabled “city of a billion,” or the other six
major underground urban centers of Arc Prime. A gray
organic plant material, called Ao by the Letnev, is found
everywhere in Arc Prime’s underground. It is Ao that
supplies the oxygen to the enormous cavern-networks,
and the plant is held in almost religious awe and respect
by the Letnev people.
Although tens of thousands of moist fungus caves are
farmed by an army of intelligent machines, the Letnev’s
great weakness has always been its shortage of food,
liquid, medicines, and essential vitamins. The
ancient Lazax kept the aggressive race in check
by maintaining strict control of the Letnev food
supplies and trade.
Throughout the time of the Lazax Empire,
the Letnev led two unsuccessful rebellions
against the Imperium. Their history of dissension
justified a constant imperial oversight of Arc
Prime and its people. The
Letnev blockade of the Quann
wormhole at the end of the Age of
Dusk was started in protest over the
Lazax sanctions and supervision. It was
the Quann conflict that ignited the Twilight Wars and
the final downfall of the empire.
After Wren Terra was annexed by the Letnev during
the latter years of the Age of Dusk, their colonies here have
been primarily occupied with growing and supplying food
for the population of Arc Prime. Foreign trade with the
Letnev consists mainly of foodstuffs, for which merchants
receive metals, weapons, and the sharp Saimoc—strong
crystals used in mining operations across the galaxy.
The Baron keeps order by maintaining a strict
bureaucracy, discipline, and an elitist military culture
that brings the strongest and the smartest directly under
his control. The pale Letnev despise light, and will often
wear protective headgear when visiting other worlds
with bright sunlight.
The legendary Letnev troops are only surpassed
in brute strength by the Tekklar N’orr elite soldiers of
distant Quinarra. With the new awakening of ambitions
among the great races, the resurgence of interstellar
commerce, and the recent momentum of the Galactic
Council, the Baron has secretly been preparing to lead
his people to final dominance. Baron Daz Emmiciel
Werqan III has only one ambition: to become emperor
at any cost.</value>

  <data name="TheClanOfSaar_History" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Few historians dispute that the Saar were the first of the
known races to venture into space, but it remains unknown
whether it was need or curiosity that drove the otherwise
primitive people into such exploration. Their peaceful ways
and dispersed civilization never promulgated them to official
Lazax recognition. Some scholars have thus called them “the
forgotten race.”
The tale of the Saar is a tragic one. Historical records are
awash with accounts of deliberate planetary expulsions, even
massacres, of Saar settlements found on planets colonized by
the other races. The musical Saar often chant the “Lay of Lisis”
in memory of the largest known Saar colony prior to Ragh’s
Call. After the planet of Lisis was annexed by the Sardakk N’orr,
no word came from the great Saar settlement there again. They
simply disappeared. In their memory, most Saar females wear
a carefully carved silver pendant called the Y’ouf Lisis, or the
“Tear of Lisis.” During the Houw Shanan, the Saar Holy Day,
such pendants are given to young Saar women, while Saar cubs
throw beetles and insects into a raging fire and the elders howl
at the stars with a longing rage.
Before the Call began, the Saar were scattered across the
galaxy, existing at the mercy of other races. On dozens of
worlds, Saar could be found living in slums and sublevel cities,
working in the most noxious and despicable industries, and
making slim sustenance from the scraps of other civilizations.
Considered unclean and barely sentient by other races, Saar
life was cheap and subject to little justice. With hard work,
polluted environments, and no access to proper medical care,
the bitter lives of the Saar were often short.
It was in the hopeless middle period of the Dark Years that
a single Saar, Ragh Gavar, would forever change the destiny of
his people.
Ragh made his living as the captain of an old scrap metal
freighter that flew between Xxehan and Sol, a route that had
been in his family for centuries. Despite being a capable trader,
Ragh’s passion lay in poetry and the imagination of the pen, in
the creation of succinct writings of hope, scrawled on paper
scraps during long trade hauls. At his ports of call, other Saar
would often congregate before his loading doors so that they
might hear his latest verses and tales. Many of his listeners
began to call him the “Captain of Hope.”
Yet one year, Ragh did not arrive at his destination.
His rusty navigation system had finally failed, and
Ragh’s ship was lost among the stars. Floating in
unknown space, as his ancestors had once done
so bravely before him, Ragh prayed that the One
Between the Stars would see him and his small
crew home.
The Call began a few years after Ragh Gavar’s
disappearance. Throughout the great expanses of
the galaxy, every Saar began to feel within himself an
unyielding longing for the stars, and especially for a certain
distant place beyond known space.
Early followers of the
Call found its origin in the
great asteroid field of Jorun, and
here found a small but blossoming
Saar colony on the two gigantic
asteroids of Ragh and Lisis II. As the Call
continued, Saar brethren from across the galaxy continued
to arrive at Jorun, together building the infrastructure of
civilization and hope for a lost race.
Years before, Ragh’s ship had crashed in the Jorun.
Miraculously, he and his crew had survived, and with great
wonder they soon discovered the mineral richness, frozen
water, atmospheric caverns, and strange fauna that lay hidden
within the endless ocean of rock.
Yet Ragh was restless in his new home. It is told that the
Captain awoke one night from a dream and then bade his
crewmates farewell, disappearing into the great network of
caverns that lies within the asteroid named after him. Ragh
Gavar was never found or heard from again. But less than a
month after his disappearance, the Call began. Saar mystics
believe that the Captain of Hope has joined the One Between
the Stars, and that he at last won forgiveness for the Saar,
and has called them to relieve their suffering. They believe
that Ragh’s Call has brought them home, that the life-giving
rocks surrounding them are the remnants of the ancient Saar
planet of origin, and that even in death it is giving its people
a second life.
For centuries the unified and passionate Saar people have
built a formidable home and civilization in the Jorun asteroid
field. The Saar have finally found home, and they have found
that they are strong</value>

    <value>Across the galaxy, planetary governors compete for trade opportunities, the Great Civilizations joust for superiority on the battlefront,
and still other, more insidious factions play at shaping galactic history
for their own ends. In a galaxy fraught with so many agendas, it’s no
surprise that the Galactic Council took it upon itself to assemble a
force of its own to manage its affairs. The Keleres of the Council are
that force, but they are also something more. They are a ragtag army of
bureaucrats, soldiers, and spies, often at odds with themselves and not
always appreciated by the galaxy they serve.
Though the Keleres are born of the Galactic Council, they are often
left to their own devices, traveling the galaxy brokering peace, intervening in conflicts, and tackling threats to galactic civilization as a
whole. They even act without the consent of the Tribunii or the Galactic Council when timeliness is a factor, only to be censured by the
Galactic Council after the fact.
The member states of the Council send recruits, who are selected
according to the traditions of each individual planet or system, to
serve in the Keleres. The Great Powers have learned, since the Keleres’s
founding, that the Keleres are a useful tool for furthering their own
designs. Rather than sending their best operatives away to the Keleres,
many send political opponents, incompetents, dangerous prisoners,
and other individuals who are difficult to do away with and undesirable to have around. On the other hand, a few Great Powers find it
prudent to send highly competent personnel, sometimes out of respect
for the Galactic Council but more often than not to clandestinely advance their own goals. The Keleres, then, are a strange and difficult
order to manage.
The Galactic Council elects three of its own to be the Tribunii of the
Keleres. Members of the Council treat the responsibility with mixed
sentiment: as both an honor and a burden. The Tribunii have the
power to command the Keleres and to implement the designs of the
Galactic Council in a concrete way. However, the mixed quality of the
Keleres means having to accept no small number of failures, which, in
turn, can hurt the Tribunii when members of the Galactic Council seek
accountability. Canny Tribunii, such as Tribunii Kuuasi Aun Jalatai,
learn when best to use the Keleres, when to set them aside, and who
among the ranks are right for the job.
The fraught political environment means that most Councilors
don’t serve as Tribunii long. In the five years since the Keleres’ founding, there have been seven Tribunii, including the current holders of
the office. Two were forced to resign in disgrace, one was killed on a
mission, and one was assassinated in an intra-agency power struggle.
For those Tribunii who meet and overcome the challenge of utilizing
the force of the Keleres, however, the fruits are significant indeed. It
requires much talent for this to happen, but when it does, it can tip the
balance of the Galactic Council itself.
The three Tribunii who currently serve are in delicate balance, and
therefore the future of the Keleres and the Imperium itself may be at
a tipping point. Kuuasi is oldest and wisest among them. Harka Leeds
is as ambitious and cunning as she is ruthless in her schemes. Odlynn
Myrr, though new to the role, brings a fresh perspective and hope for
unity and stability in the Imperium.
Despite the delicate balance of power between the Tribunii, the
Keleres represent the Galactic Council and, as such, must embody the
unity of the galaxy, not just the whims of its leaders. The Great Civilizations, however, frequently compete with one another in trade, war,
and politics. Though some conflict can cement the bonds of a society,
too much can just as easily rip it apart. Thus, the diverse skills of the
Keleres are brought to bear on missions of peace and negotiation.
At times, the Keleres act as a neutral party or temporary ally among
factions at war. Negotiation, knowledge of history, and familiarity with
alien species pave the way to peace and prosperity for the galaxy. They
broker peace on the one hand, but join battles on the other, especially
when violence seems to be the only means to stability</value>

  <data name="TheEmbersOfMuaat_History" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It was during the early years of the Age of Dusk that Jol-Nar
explorers came upon the volcanic planet of Muaat. Scouting
for resources beyond the Mahact Plateau, the explorers were
amazed by the mineral wealth of their discovery, but they
were truly awestruck by the extraordinary qualities of the
planet’s fiery inhabitants, the Gashlai.
The Gashlai were unlike any race known to the Jol-Nar:
sentient beings with bodies slowly consumed by a fiery
heat. After their conception, the Gashlai cocooning process
somehow enables conversion of energy into mass—a process
hinted at by scientific theory, but forever thought unattainable
on a sub-cosmic scale.
The Jol-Nar benefited greatly from Muaat’s resources, yet
they were frustrated in their attempts to replicate the Gashlai
cocooning process. Instead, the Gashlai proved useful as
slave labor, as the Headmasters transformed the orbit of
Muaat into a massive shipyard for their navy. It was here, at
the Muaat shipyards, that the construction of a secret Jol-Nar
superweapon began.
The Gashlai suffered tragically under their enslavement
by the Jol-Nar, but events of the early Twilight Wars would
dramatically change their ill fortune.
Just after the Twilight Wars erupted, a Jol-Nar expedition
party searching for mineral deposits on Muaat became
infected by an organism in the Doolak Mountains. The
infection developed into a disease later known as the Doolak
plague. The covert, yet frequent, traffic between Muaat and
the Garian star system allowed for the spread of the virus to
the Jol Nar home worlds.
The plague became one of the greatest disasters in JolNar history, and only the early research of Gashlai biology
allowed the Headmasters to devise a vaccine before the entire
Jol-Nar population was destroyed. Before the Jol-Nar could
recover from this disaster, their military offensive collapsed,
and soon the Headmasters would face the ruthless advance of
the Sardakk N’orr.
As the Jol-Nar navy retreated, the Headmasters were
forced to call forth their secret weapon at Muaat. This
weapon—an enormous battle vessel called the “War Sun”—
was not yet entirely complete, but with their fates clinging to
the defenses of the Saudor system, the Headmasters had no
choice but to bring it to bear against the enemy.
As the War Sun left its Muaat moorings, and as the majority
of the remaining Jol-Nar personnel left with it, the Gashlai
finally carved their own destiny. Having long schemed against
their enslavers, they incinerated the remaining Jol-Nar in the
system, capturing the shipyard and every available scientific
document left behind by their hated oppressors.
Not long after their
costly victory at Saudor, the
Jol-Nar sought to return to their
colony at Muaat, but found that all
communications with the system had
been severed. Exploratory ships sent to
Muaat would not return. Though the Headmasters suspected
what might have taken place on their old colony, they were
unable to return there in force again.
Throughout the long Dark Years, the Gashlai prospered.
Clad in Ember suits, special body armor shielding the
Gashlai from the cold and others from their lethal heat, a
large assembly of Gashlai envoys have recently arrived at
Mecatol Rex, demanding recognition and representation. The
High Fire Warden Sushon Azh has simultaneously sent forth
Gashlai ambassadors to all the great races in the distinctive
gold-bronze frigates of the Gashlai.
Yet one such ambassador did not arrive in a frigate. As the
Gashlai ambassador assigned to the Jol-Nar sailed past the
Garian star and began his approach to Jol, the Headmasters
paled in fear, for this representative arrived in a War Sun, a
copy of their own ancient designs. The message was not
wasted on the Headmasters. Their former slaves had become
formidable, and they had not forgotten, or forgiven, the past.
Led by the Fire Wardens, the Gashlai are resolved to never
be enslaved again. Inside their golden Ember suits they burn
with ambition. The Jol-Nar fear what the rest of the galaxy is
about to learn: that the Embers of Muaat intend to bring their
fire to the furthest reaches of space, burning the unwilling
into submission.</value>

    <value>Under the punishing rays of the massive star
Kenara lies the tri-system of the Hacan, each of
its three satellites wrapped in the yellow haze so
distinctive of desert planets. These three jewels are
called Arretze, Kamdorn, and Hercant. Here, the
united Emirates of the Hacan have grown a mighty
civilization of warriors, nomads, farmers, and above
all, merchants.
The Kenara system is one of the most heavily
trafficked in the known universe. Only the wormhole
portal systems see more traffic in any given cycle.
From Kenara, an untold number of Hacan and other
merchant vessels traverse the galaxy. This traffic is
supported by entire cities of space stations that provide
the warehousing, logistics, maintenance, banking,
entertainment, and other necessities facilitating the
constant flow of goods, ships, and crew.
On the surface of the three hot desert planets,
life is slower and more serene. Only life in the city of
Harcarun on the planet Arretze matches the breathless
pace of the space above. Located in a shadowy vale
near the Arretze northern pole, Harcarun is the only
city in the tri-system that has a fixed position. Its
permanent location and almost bearable climate has
made Harcarun the primary point of operation for
most non-native trading corporations, financiers,
and opportunists. The Hacan, despite their uncanny
ability for establishing financial relationships and
building trade, generally despise the chaotic lifestyle
and, to them, windy cold of Harcarun.
The Hacan people dwell mostly in cities built
on massive dust-sleds, constantly moving to cooler
climates as the desert seasons shift. Although some
technology has been introduced in the last hundred
years, most Hacan cities are still pulled by vast herds
of Tuuran beasts, whose gill-like skin membranes
take moisture from the very air itself.
In their distant past, the
Hacan were a poor species,
their exploits into space dwarfed
by the other great races of the
Imperium. Then slowly the Hacan discovered an
insatiable off-worlder lust for special products
grown under Kenara’s blinding light or dug from the
deep sands of their homeworlds. The intoxicating
gerr root, clothes made from the starflowers
that only rise during Hercant’s equinox, Spehat
aphrodisiacs, liquors, medicines, and forbidden
drugs: all harvested and manufactured by the crafty
and patient hands of the Hacan.
Soon the Hacan became masters of trade, and their
system prospered as unfathomable fortunes were
made by the increasingly powerful trading clans, chief
among them the Mowshir Emirate of Arretze. The
desire to protect their newfound wealth, and a will to
peacefully regulate and arbitrate between the clans,
moved the Hacan to form a representative gathering
and to elect a Quieron—the leader who speaks for all
the Hacan. The Quieron leads the entire hierarchy
of trade-groups, each possessing its own fleets of
commerce and war. His task: to lead his people to the
Imperial Throne, establishing an era of wealth and
peaceful commerce.</value>

  <data name="TheEmpyrean_History" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Since time immemorial, travelers have told tales of the Empyrean, enigmatic beings who live in the depths of space. The oldest Jol-Nar libraries have references to faceless creatures who sailed the void long before the Hylar left their watery cradle. Winnaran custodians still maintain fragmented historical documents that managed to survive the ancient Sol bombardment and suggest that the Empyrean predate the discovery of supraluminal travel, a technology so old that no race has presented credible evidence that they invented it first. If these records are to be believed, the Empyrean have been crossing the vast gulf of space in sublight vessels for tens of thousands of years before the first FTL drives made galactic civilization possible. Whether or not this is true, historians agree that whenever a species establishes colonies beyond their homeworld, the Empyrean arrive to observe their progress. They tend to lurk on the edges of star systems, making no effort to announce their presence. They can remain drifting in the outer cometary halos for centuries, occasionally sending unobtrusive probes orbiting through the inner system for closer observations. Though they do not actively avoid confrontations, anthropologists and diplomats who have attempted to establish contact with the Empyrean tend to find them frustratingly noncommunicative. Individual Empyrean tend to avoid answering questions about their purpose in observing the actions of other species, or about themselves or their civilization. Though they are sometimes referred to as the galaxy’s “historians,” nobody knows if the Empyrean keep a unified record of galactic events. If they do, they have not shared it with anyone else. Most of what is known of the Empyrean has been gleaned through direct observation. The most startling fact about them is that they are a species who survive in space. Their ships have no pressurized compartments, and beyond some radiation and debris protection, are completely exposed to vacuum. The Empyrean themselves have no visible sensory organs or orifices, and seem to spend much of their time absorbing starlight with the great leathery wings that protrude from their backs. Their body shape does suggest that they evolved on a planet’s surface, leading some scientists to suggest that their original home may have been largely airless. Others believe that at some point in the distant past, the Empyrean were a more traditional avian species who biocrafted themselves to thrive in the vacuum of space. Whatever their origins, most species find interacting with the Empyrean difficult. Communication isn’t a problem— individual Empyrean are able to broadcast radio waves that can be picked up by most standard comms devices—but patience is. The Empyrean act slowly and deliberately, perhaps a consequence of subsisting on the meager solar energy of stars, or possibly because of their extremely long lifespans. They can spend hours or even days contemplating an answer to a single question. In addition, Empyrean society seems to operate as a form of communal anarchy. They make decisions based on the consensus of all Empyrean currently present. They seem cooperative enough that this works, but it does mean governments have no way to negotiate with the “whole of the Empyrean people.” They do, however, make some effort to engage with other sentients, such as donning clothing to make guests feel at ease. They also engage in trade for rare metals and trace elements in exchange for new astronomical and scientific information. Most species tend to ignore the Empyrean unless they seek some esoteric knowledge, or the Empyrean approach them first. In recent years, more and more black-winged Empyrean ships have begun to gather near major trade lanes and on the outskirts of civilized systems. Some free traders have begun to refuse to follow the deep space commerce trails, repeating rumors that ships have begun to vanish in greater numbers, and Empyrean craft have been sighted following lone vessels. One Empyrean ship has even traveled to Mecatol Rex, and individuals who say they speak for the Empyrean have engaged in long meetings with the Winnarans in Mecatol City. These representatives say they believe the galaxy will soon be engulfed by a storm worse than the Twilight Wars of a millennia ago. They maintain that the struggle for the throne will tear the galaxy to shreds, and that none of the rising powers have the mandate or the moral authority to rule over their fellows. Instead, the Empyrean have come to believe that only a truly neutral arbitrator can hope to rule a galactic Empire; an arbitrator that already knows all other species better than they know themselves.</value>

Jord, the ancestral home of the human race. Few
planets can rival Jord’s diversity of climates, seasons,
and ecology. Much of this wealth is attributed to its
enormous moon, which causes dramatic tidal motions
in Jord’s oceans, which is thought to be the impetus of
its diverse life and weather patterns. Much of Jord’s
orbit, as well as its moon, is crowded with stellar traffic
from the orbital and lunar space stations. Military
ships of the line, bearing the distinctive Sol symbol,
are often moored to the bulky military platforms in
Jord’s orbit, or to the fleet base Churchill Prima that
orbits the reddish fourth planet of the system.
The humans themselves represent the most
numerous and most diverse species of the galaxy. Since
the discovery of the mass-drive, humans have left Jord
to explore, and they continue to explore, the distant
corners of space. Humans can be found in all corners
of the galaxy and seem to demonstrate the greatest
variation in intellect and application of skills. Human
colonies and settlements can be found everywhere,
as can human servants, traders, cartographers,
explorers, mercenaries, scholars, construction crews,
smugglers, scientists, diplomats, etc. It is commonly
recognized among galactic historians that it has been
the diversified skills of the human race that has been
the determining factor in avoiding annihilation or
extinction.
Of the untold billions of humans that dwell across
the galaxy, all of whose ancestors once migrated from
the Sol system, most feel no allegiance or kinship to
the Sol Federation or the humans of Jord. Some feel
a traditional friendship, while a few remain loyal to
Sol and its policies. Being the last civilization to be
admitted into the imperial council, it is ironic that Sol
was the first to openly declare war against the failing
empire. It was a Sol fleet that fired the first shot at the
Letnev blockade of the Quann wormhole, escalating
the minor conflict into the full scale galactic war that
was the Twilight Wars.
The Sol Federation of
Nations is governed by the biannually elected High Minister,
who has the executive control of the
economy, budget, and Sol military. The executive
powers of the High Minister are held in check by
three distinct governing houses: The House of Law,
The House of the People, and The House of Industry.
The four governing bodies of the Federation are all
centrally located in the massive metropolis of New
Moscow, a bustling center of politics, trade, and
high culture.
The current High Minister, Juan Salvador Tao,
is preparing for a new age that he knows is rapidly
evolving before him. He is eager to expand the
official colonization of the Sol Federation once more,
especially to the old colonies of Centauri, Gral,
and Quann. He knows that the balance of power is
shifting and that the universe will soon once again be
governed under one empire. The High Minister will
make sure that his Federation will prevail during the
coming power struggle and inevitable war. Already
the Sol fleet awaits his orders to strike nearby
systems. Soon the human destiny will be fulfilled,
and the distant suns theirs to command.</value>

    <value>They’re ghost stories. Frightful tales whispered to children
by nightcycle lamps. Dread accounts told to fellow sailors in
the humming darkness of long-haul freighters.
Even now, in our growing enlightenment, when we know
so much more about the Shaleri passage and its strange
inhabitants, the sheer differentness of the Shaleri and its Ghosts
seduce such tales to persist.
An almost endless variation of hearsay and rumor can
be found on the topic of the Shaleri anomaly. Rare records
of purported fact are, at best, of irregular verifiability. While
now a respected sociological study, what is truly known of the
Shaleri remains infinitely smaller than the abundance of myth
that clouds its past.
For millennia, space in proximity of the Shaleri anomaly
has been mistrusted and avoided by spacefarers. Despite the
undeniable historic universality in avoiding this region, few
concrete explanations have been made as to the reason for such
aversion. Some simply denote the area as “high risk.” Others
conjecture that the area ebbs with “unknown radiation.”
Regrettably, most navigation records simply refer to the Shaleri
region as “bad space”—the superstitious space-faring analogy
of “here be dragons.”
What is known for sure is that Shaleri space has over time
been responsible for an unusually high number of missing
vessels. An extraordinarily high number, in fact. For such a
high proportion of lost traffic the absence of distress beacons,
message capsules, or any signs whatsoever of the missing
ships has been described in official records as “disturbing.” It
is perhaps more aptly described, using a favored term of sailors
and storytellers, as spooky.
The mystery of the Shaleri region goes further and deeper
than just that of missing spaceships. Among crews that have
safely made journeys through the region, there are records
of strange equipment malfunctions, bad dreams, and sudden
illnesses. There are accounts of purported “sightings”: eldritch
encounters with beings described as strange fibrous clouds of
energy. While such accounts may have been dismissed in the
past as the fantasies of oxygen-deprived sailors, the hindsight
of the galaxy’s recent association with the Ghosts places these
reports in a more credible light.
There are several trade routes that when traced through rather
than around Shaleri space will save the traveler substantial time
and fuel. It follows, therefore, that willingness to brave its dark
reputation has come with substantial profit for those captains
who have dared to travel in this “bad space” and returned to tell
the tale. It was in pursuit of such profit that the Mentak frigate
Entropic undertook its fifth journey though Shaleri space.
The Entropic had been traveling through Shaleri space for
three days when it was interdicted by three formidable vessels
of unknown origin. The vessels, each the size of a Mentak
battlecruiser, were of grey lobstered steel, their surface intricately
inscribed with interweaving runic latticework. It is this meeting
between the Entropic and the Creuss warships that is marked as
First Contact between the Ghosts of Creuss and a member race
of the galactic council.
It’s not known why the
beings that dwell within
the Shaleri anomaly (now
commonly called the “Creuss
Gate”) chose to reveal themselves
during the early Years of Awakening.
Perhaps they’d finally learned enough about the galaxy
that surrounded them? Perhaps their societal progress had
finally propelled them into the greater universe? A more
ominous possibility, one favored by storytellers, is that the
Ghosts of Creuss have come forth for some sinister purpose
yet to be revealed.
As beings of energy and light, the Ghosts certainly can
be placed among the strangest of the known races. The
famous historian Merean Barqan described them as “ethereal
luxsynaptic souls.” As their forms do not remain stable outside
the strange gravity of the Creuss itself, the Ghosts garb
themselves in intricate metalwork. Not only does the armor
stabilize the Ghosts, but its tangible shape places members
of the other races more at ease in their presence. Individual
Creuss can be discerned from one another by the unique
design of their helmets, which, like their ships, are intricately
carved with runes.
The Ghosts of Creuss have shown themselves to be perfectly
civilized, polite, and masters of many strange sciences and
materials. Yet, they’re also regarded as exceptionally secretive,
ritualistic, and prickly on a wide range of matters. It’s generally
undecided whether their behavior is one to be expected of a
race so recently introduced to the material galaxy, or whether
these are signs that something more ominous lurks beneath
their brooding metal helmets.</value>

    <value>It has been 13 years since the Hacan trader Zollar was lost,
its final desperate broadcast intercepted by a Yssaril outpost
near the Mahact asteroid fields.
The last transmission of the Zollar told a grim story. After
leaving Moll Primus in the Mahact region, its navigation
equipment failed, and its crew found themselves lost far
beyond the remote borderlands. After nearly two weeks adrift
in deep space, they were suddenly hailed by a great warship
of unknown origin. The crew’s joy soon turned to terror. The
warship closed, bringing its broadside cannons to bear on the
helpless freighter. The Hacan captain was able to send a final
emergency broadcast before his ship was destroyed.
Not long after the disappearance of the Zollar, a mighty alien
fleet appears on the outskirts of Yssaril space. From that fleet, a
small delegation of representatives travels to Mecatol, submitting
an ancestral claim to the Imperial Throne. They claim to be the
true remnants of the ancient Lazax, now calling themselves the
L1Z1X (“Ell Won Zee Won Ex”). Grisly to behold, they resemble
the Lazax, but utterly changed, their bodies almost entirely
overtaken by invasive cybernetic implants.
The Winnaran custodians are deeply divided over the issue.
Some claim that the L1Z1X are not the ruling race, but a new
and potentially dangerous hybrid. Other Winnarans argue that
the Lazax have returned, in unexpected form, but returned
nonetheless, and that their custodianship is over.
A Winnaran observer has been allowed to visit the L1Z1X
home world, called “0.0.0” by its inhabitants, or “Null” by most
others. The observer has not yet returned, and the L1Z1X
remain a largely unknown entity. What little is known of them
has been provided by the L1Z1X themselves, or obtained from
a few old records provided by the Jol-Nar Regents.
From the Hylar records and from the L1Z1X claim, it has
been inferred that the L1Z1X history started during the final
days of the Lazax. It was less than a year before the great bombing
of Mecatol that a councilor to the Emperor by the name of Ibna
Vel Syd saw the impending doom. The Emperor and his other
councilors refused to listen to Ibna’s dire warnings. Soon Ibna
grew frustrated with their myopia. Although the Lazax navy was
clearly failing, although droves of systems were daily joining
the three rebellions, although trade had entirely failed, and
food supplies on Mecatol were running out, the Emperor and
his cabinet simply could not comprehend that their birthright,
their empire, could possibly fall.
Refusing to share the fate of his liege, Ibna Vel Syd began
secretly planning a furtive diaspora for his own family and
the few thousand Lazax who shared his fears. With him, Ibna
sought to bring the pillars of Lazax culture, technology, and
knowledge. He even managed to persuade a small group of
Hylar scientists to join him, recognizing that the Hylar’s skill
was instrumental to the underlying technology of the empire.
Then, on a fateful night
during the seventy-second
year of the Twilight Wars, two
freighters, the Manda and the
Hurwana, and Ibna’s own cruiser, Syd,
left the great spaceport of Mecatol City.
Below them, the great Hall of Cartography burned. So fearful
had Ibna been of discovery and persecution by the Lazax’s
enemies that he had engineered the destruction of any record
that could possible identify his secret destination: a cold but
adequate planet orbiting the small star Hazz, far beyond the
borderlands.
It is guessed that the colony, struggling to survive, started
to rely almost exclusively on technology to assist them in
their hardships. Presumably helped by the small contingent of
Hylar, technology crept into their lives and bodies, until they
became almost indistinguishable from it.
It is rumored that Ibna Vel Syd still leads his people,
encased in eldritch technology that keeps his ancient body
alive. Whether the L1Z1X are guided by the wisdom that
saved them or by the insanity that destroyed the famed Hall
of Cartography, it is not known. Behind their vacant red eyes
lie both a tragic history and a terrible malevolence. It seems
certain that the return of the Lazax will wash across the galaxy
like a tide of prophecy and steel.</value>

  <data name="TheMahactGeneSorcerers_History" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Gene-sorcerers. Mad tyrants. Kings. The Mahact are a primal tale from ancient history. In the distant past, the Mahact dynasties terrorized the galaxy with their infighting and genesorcery. They could warp the forms of living beings, compel eternal obedience with a gesture, and turn the biospheres of entire worlds into seething, caustic hells. They unleashed their most vile technologies in war or even in debauched sport, and it seemed, even as their houses crumbled, that their fall might bring down all of civilized space. But in the midst of their orgy of self-destruction, a new Empire rose to challenge them. The Lazax, a young and fiery race, led the effort to destroy the Mahact and restore peace. When the last Mahact King was slain, the Lazax claimed the fruits of their victory, establishing just dominion over the ashes of the Mahact’s kingdoms. However, the truth was somewhat more complicated than the Lazax wished anyone to remember. The new Empire did overthrow the Mahact Kings, slaying many of them and claiming the Mahact’s main fortress of Mecatol as their own. However, the Mahact were too powerful to defeat utterly. The last of them retreated from Mecatol, sowing anarchy and chaos in their wake, and leaving agents and sleepers to do their bidding. They fled the galaxy to their original home, the planet of Ixth. This world lay far beyond the furthest wisps of dust on the galactic arms, unreachable except through the great wormhole gate of Acheron. Here, in their ancient fastness, the remaining Mahact plotted their eventual return. The Lazax pursued their foes to the entrance of the gate on Acheron, but every attempt they made to invade Ixth failed. So the young Empire tried a different plan. They studied the gate’s arcane workings, and though they could not destroy it, they could shut it down. Thus, Lazax engineers deactivated the gate and buried its machinery beneath an entire ocean to guarantee that none would ever discover it again. They even purged all nearby worlds of life, turning surrounding space into a wilderness. Without control of the machinery on Acheron, the Mahact could not reopen their gate, or even rip it free and set its endpoint somewhere else in the galaxy. They were trapped on their dying world, overlooking a galaxy that was steadily forgetting their existence. Eventually, the remaining Mahact entered the stasis crypts beneath their dead city, to sleep until the stars burned out around them. And there they remained, until the Creuss expedition discovered the Acheron gate, opened it, and awoke them. In an instant, the first Mahact saw the Creuss explorers and used arcane techno-rituals to dominate them and summon their ships through the Acheron Gate. Then, having no desire to remain prisoners on Ixth, the Mahact used the gate machinery to rip Ixth free from its star and hurl it into the heart of the galaxy. Never again would they be trapped on their homeworld. Now Ixth sails untethered through the galactic core, and the Mahact survey their former domain. Though there are only a handful of them left, each has the power of eons of technosorcery at their fingertips. The remaining Mahact turn to their own holdings, awakening their Ixthian bio-factories and assemblers, and summoning their dormant agents and their genetic descendants. The corridors and halls of Ixth’s great city-machines fill with the gene-sorcerers’ thrall clones. Immense dreadnoughts have begun to rise from the underground assembler halls to hang in orbit over the planet. Legions of genecrafted warriors assemble in the mustering squares, ready to march to war. As the Mahact began to marshal their forces, a single golden ship appeared in orbit over Mecatol Rex. It descended to the Senate Possessional in the heart of Mecatol City, touching down on the perfectly manicured trille grass lawn. The hatches opened, and four emissaries stepped out. Each was one of the observers the Council had dispatched to the Creuss expedition to Ixth, reported lost by the few survivors who escaped. Now they wore robes of gold and steel, and were flanked by hulking Creuss legionaries, whose armor seethed with an ominous crimson glow. They walked into the chambers of the Galactic Senate without fanfare or invitation and stood in the middle of the hall. Before the stunned audience, they announced that they were the emissaries of Vertar Auran Oblis, first amongst the galaxy’s rightful race of rulers. They went on to say that, as Oblis was a magnanimous ruler, all those who surrendered immediately would be favored slaves. The emissaries returned to their ship and left the city behind. However, many fear that it is only a matter of time before a golden armada returns to the sky above Mecatol Rex. And when it does, the Mahact will return the world to the center of their kingdom.</value>

    <value>Beyond the Mahact Plateau, part of the borderlands
and the old star route known as the Passage of Tears,
lies distant Moll Primus with its three tiny moons. The
young planet is predominantly covered by extensive
plains of the orange meet grass and sprinkled with a
million lakes. Sharp youthful mountains pierce the heart
of many of its continents, their icy mountain streams
giving life to steep lush mountain valleys, where green
fruitful trees and flowers grow in colorful contrast to the
orange plains.
Although rich for exploitation, the remoteness of
Moll Primus allowed the planet to go without organized
colonization by the Lazax for thousands of years after
its discovery. After the failed Gandar rebellion, however,
the Lazax started to use the planet as a penal colony,
a distant prison, for the worst offending political
dissidents and other criminals from all races. Exile to
Moll Primus meant a long journey in the bowels of a
prison freighter along the Passage of Tears, a winding
dark journey around the treacherous gravity wells of the
Mahact Plateau. Only the remote planet Hope’s End lies
farther than Moll Primus on the Passage of Tears. Once
on Moll Primus, prisoners were assigned to manual
labor under the supervision of one of the regional
planetary Governors. The Governors of Moll Primus
mostly consisted of Lazax politicians or servicemen
fallen into disgrace. An assignment to Moll Primus was
as much a sentence to a Lazax public career as it was a
prison for its population. Thus, the Governors were often
incompetent, cruel, and bitter individuals. Although the
planet itself was quite pleasant, even considered beautiful,
its prisoner population was tortured, malnourished, and
forced to fight in small-scale wars against the population
of neighboring Governors.
Then, after more than 800 years, the Twilight Wars
began. As the empire crumbled, as the supply ships
and supervision from Mecatol Rex became infrequent
and finally failed, the Governors panicked. Some fled
the planet overnight with their entire households.
Others perished in the inevitable prisoner revolts that
followed. Before the Twilight Wars had subsided, Moll
Primus was free. Some of its most recent prisoners soon
left, but for most of its mixed-race population, Moll
Primus was home. After the united rebellion against the
Governor wardens, a brief period of infighting among
the different regions followed.
A single human, Erwan Mentak,
soon brought the regions together
in a final peace and, before he died,
prosperity.
Today, Moll Primus is governed by the Table of
Captains, elected leaders from each region. Among
them a single leader is chosen every ten cycles and
granted the honorary title Erwan’s Hand or “the Hand”
for short. Helped by their Hylar brothers, the coalition
has made great progress in advancing their technological
status. Metals mined from Moll Primus’s moons, various
products made from the rich meet grass, income from
“special” fleet excursions, and the hard work of its
population have slowly formed the strong economic
backbone of a proud civilization.
Although publicly denied by Mentak ambassadors,
the Mentak employ a vast pirating fleet which wreaks
havoc among merchant shipping lanes and smaller
military convoys. Although now an educated culture
and civilization in their own right, the Mentak people
have never forgotten their roots as rogues and usurpers.
Every Mentak feels a historical need for revenge:
revenge against a galaxy that shipped their ancestors to
torture and rot on Moll Primus centuries ago. The Table
of Captains has given their Hand a clear mandate: to
scheme, pillage, and conquer until the ruled are rulers
and the enslaved are emperors.</value>

space, but no records of any derelict or amnesic Yssaril crews
have ever been recorded. The Naalu, it was later discovered to
the horror of their neighbors, are highly telepathic and armed
with technology and weapons that redirect, manipulate, or
damage the neuron impulses guiding the brains of all major
known races.
A secret prior relationship between the Yssaril Guild
of Spies and the mind-bending Naalu goes a long way in
explaining how the Naalu, a seemingly isolated civilization
claiming no prior contact with the rest of the galaxy, developed
premium civilian and military technology similar, and in some
cases superior, to the rest of the galaxy.
Soon after the appearance of the Naalu, several of the
great races, seeing the potential of a powerful new ally in the
empire’s midst, sought to win their allegiance. After learning
of the Naalu’s telepathic power, however, and after witnessing
the strange arrogance of the beautiful Naalu, many quickly
retrieved their envoys and diplomats in a healthy fear of the
mind-reading serpentine race.
Despite originating on the dank and nondescript
planet Maaluk, the Naalu have taken the breathtakingly
beautiful Druaa as their home world. Most Naalu will scoff
at any mention of their Maaluk heritage, and recent Naalu
generations often seek to contest even hard scientific evidence
which indicates that their proud, stoic race originated from
any planet other than the scenic Druaa—especially the
stinking bogs and mist-plains of Maaluk.
The Druaa seldom communicate with each other
by speaking. Their telepathic communication is more
effective, facilitates emotional as well as intelligent
understanding, and has allowed the collective to
prevent larger internal wars, which in turn has
spurred their rapid advance in culture, technology
(assisted by the Yssaril), and the creation of the
Naalu fleet and military might. Unless speaking to offworlders, the Naalu use their voices only for their music
– hauntingly alluring arias of melodic hissing.
The Naalu have kept the
pristine beauty of their crystal
cities and Druaa’s environment
intact by locating most of their
heavy industries on Maaluk. These
industries are manned by the Miashan, a
low-sentient marshland race enslaved by the Naalu to work in
the great iron-extraction plants, underground gas mines, and
on the thousands of rodent farms. Raw materials are promptly
shipped to Druaa, stored in massive underground warehouses,
and distributed to the Druaa cities by airborne gliders.
The leader of the Naalu collective is always female, as
most Naalu leaders and off-world representatives are female.
For the last decade, the tall red-scaled Q’uesh Sish has ruled
the collective from her palace in the shining crystal city of
Eershin. The beautiful, sleek spaceships of the Naalu patrol
Mallac’s outer borders, while Naalu troops train and muster
on Druaa’s two moons. With her Nefishh, a rare crystal radium
device, Q’uesh sees the minds of the other races. She smiles
at the knowledge, and with her, the collective Naalu leaders
smile, sensing the knowledge in her mind and relishing the
sweet poison of her thoughts. The great plan of the collective is
about to take its final shape. Long have the Naalu observed the
chaos and ugliness of the other races from a distance. The time
nears that the beauty of Druaa will grow beyond the borders
of Mallac. The time now nears when the rest of the galaxy will
know the tranquility, order, and the true beauty of the Naalu.
They will submit to that beauty... or be destroyed.</value>

  <data name="TheNaazRokhaAlliance_History" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Naaz have had the distinct misfortune of being a species of technological savants who were discovered by other races before they could build their own civilization. In the chaotic aftermath of the Twilight Wars, their world of Naazir was happened upon by scouts for a Winnu corporate-collective. The collective promptly set up an industrial colony on Naazir and began exploiting the talents of the Naaz. This continued until the corporate leaders were charged and prosecuted for their crimes against sentients… at which point a small army of Sol deserters invaded and claimed Naazir as their own. The pattern continued for centuries, with the Naaz barely able to rid themselves of one conqueror before being invaded by the next. Eventually, a network of Naaz rebels gathered enough resources to try a new plan. To get rid of their current overlords (an alliance of Letnev merchant-princes), they would hire an equally downtrodden group of mercenaries— the Rokha. The Rokha are a race of felids, distant relatives of the Hacan who long ago split with their genetic cousins. Their story since the Twilight Wars had also been one of tragedy, forced to become a race of nomad warriors, employed as mercenaries but barred from settling in any civilized system in the galaxy. To the Rokha, the Naaz were just one more in a long line of employers. But that would change. The nascent alliance between the Naaz and the Rokha proved successful, driving the merchant princes from their world. However, in the aftermath of the victory, the Naaz did something the Rokha did not expect. They offered them the chance to settle on Naazir and join the Naaz in a unified society. Exhausted from centuries of a nomadic life, the Rokha accepted. Together, the Naaz-Rokha Alliance proved much greater than the sum of its parts. Not only did the two species complement one another, their shared history as the galaxy’s outcasts drove them to work all the harder together to ensure neither would be taken advantage of again. The two cultures didn’t just co-exist, they merged. Every level of NaazRokha society became an equal partnership, from families (a typical Naaz-Rokha family consists of two Naaz and two Rokha, plus any children from either couple) to government (the Alliance Chamber of Congress is overseen by an executive Tetrarchy of two Naaz and two Rokha who each oversee different portions of Alliance territory). When any elected official steps down, only an official from the other species is allowed to take their place. And when the Alliance terraformed and colonized one of Naazir’s neighboring worlds so that the Rokha could have a homeworld of their own, the population of the new world was equally divided between both species—the same as on Naazir. The Alliance would undoubtedly have been satisfied to build their own civilization and keep the other races from exploiting it. However, the Creuss expedition to Ixth changed their trajectory. Two of the few survivors from that illfated adventure were a pair of Naaz-Rokha scientists. They, along with a few lucky others, were able to escape aboard a Letnev corvette even as the rest of the expedition was captured by the Mahact. Then, as the other survivors reported to the Council, the scientists returned to Naazir with precious readings from the Acheron gateway, as well as the machinery that created it. Using this invaluable information as a starting point, the Alliance has discovered a means of creating momentary microwormholes into another dimension and tapping the energy released during that process. This “entropic field harvesting” has proven marvelously efficient. Alliance ships and factories now drink deeply from entropic field taps, and the other galactic powers have suddenly been confronted by the reality that two species they long ago dismissed and exploited are now very real players on the galactic stage. As chaos builds around the Mahact return, the Tetrarchy has stood before the Chamber of Congress and announced its intent. The Naaz-Rokha Alliance has already demonstrated that two species can live harmoniously as one. Who better to take control of the ancient seat of the Imperium and bring that harmonious cooperation to the stars?</value>

    <value>On the eve of the Lazax empire’s fall, the legendary
councilor Ibna Vel Syd led a small contingent of his people on
a secret exodus into unknown space and, in doing so, escaped
the massacre of his people that would follow. Only with the
help of increasingly extreme technological augmentation did
they survive the early years of resettlement. This reliance on
technology became the foundation of what would evolve into
the vast cybernetic civilization of the L1Z1X.
While the narrative of Ibna’s early struggles are common lore,
few know of the much darker struggle that shadows the L1Z1X’s
past: the great schism which ravaged their society a thousand
years before their belligerent return to known space. The scions
of Vel Syd were rapidly accumulating the power needed to return
to known space and reclaim their lost empire. Already, detailed
plans circulated in the Mindnet with that very goal. Then came
the madness of Mordai.
Mordai was the greatest of the L1Z1X enhancers. His
innovation and industry made him foremost among the L1Z1X
elite. He worked tirelessly for the advancement of the Mindnet,
always using his own body as the first subject for any new
brilliant augmentation of his invention. He was meticulous,
inspirational, and brazenly ambitious. He believed in the
possibility of the perfect existential reality: an apex of the living
soul and the helpful machine.
Unsurprisingly, such hubris would meet its nemesis. As
Mordai underwent the self-imposed implant of a cortex migrator,
the first of several devices leading to this final ascension,
something went horribly awry. It’s assumed that the smallest
of software glitches existed in the cortex module, overlooked
even by the meticulous Mordai. As the software began to iterate
and integrate with Mordai’s neural activity, it began a powerful
recursive disease, a virus that would infect Mordai’s sanity.
The personality changes in Mordai were subtle at first. A
new subtext entered his work. He had come to believe that the
conscious machine was the true higher form of being, one more
naturally fit to rule the galaxy than the accident of phosphorous
chemistry at the primordial heart of biomatter.
Mordai began a series of severe operations to excise the
biology of his own body, encouraging and coercing his staff
and investors to do the same. Mordai’s charismatic preaching
soon gained momentum. His growing cadre of followers, calling
themselves the Nekro, began clandestine assaults on their
unwilling brethren, forcefully submitting them to the removal
of living tissue.
By the time the leaders of the Mindnet came to realize that
the Nekro movement had to be stopped, Mordai had completed
his transformation into a fully mechanical being: a gibbering
arachnid of black metal, mad with recursive corruption and
the hunger to perpetuate. The efficiency of the Nekro virus was
astounding. Mordai’s body had been rebuilt as a micro-factory,
and from it thousands of microscopic insectile machines
sprung forth, attaching themselves to any technology in sight,
replicating Mordai’s madness with horrible speed.
Rebuilding themselves to Mordai’s visions, the new
machines became reproductive. Perceiving the threat posed by
the Mindnet, they quickly began to construct an army with a
single terrifying purpose:
the utter elimination of all
organic matter.
The war to subdue the Nekro
virus was a great setback for the
L1Z1X. The virus’s numbers were
legion and its visage sprung from Mordai’s nightmares. From
scorpion-inspired Defilers to the giant Mordreds, each new
Nekro model was more demonic and deadly than the last.
Replenishing this evil army were the monstrous Abbadons:
moving factories that ravenously consumed all materials in
their path, seamlessly feeding fresh metals to their internal
construction facilities.
This civil war lasted about five years, with the Mindnet
ultimately vanquishing the virus. It took the L1Z1X nearly five
centuries to regain their former strength, and another five to
arrive at their current power. With no new Nekro instantiation
resurfacing for near 700 years, the L1Z1X came to believe the
virus was wiped out forever. Until now.
In light of the recent Nekro resurgence, it is conjectured that
a virus-infested orbital satellite must have escaped Null’s gravity
during the schism and vanished undetected into rim space.
Here, it must have traveled silently for years until it was pulled
into a mineral-rich planet somewhere at the edge of the galaxy.
Left alone to its own devices, the virus was able to adapt and
replicate again.
Some will seek to understand and find common ground
with the Nekro, preaching tolerance for the intolerant. But those
who have seen the devastated systems absorbed by the resurgent
Nekro know that while angels remain a fantasy of the hopeful,
out of the darkness have come demons. And in their wake
follows blackness and death.</value>

    <value>Shortly before the Creuss Expedition left to plumb the depths of Shaleri Space, a number of sensor nets and observatories began to receive messages broadcast from the very heart of the galaxy. These messages repeated in a multitude of languages, and warned of a dark future to come that must be prevented at all costs. What struck the various scientists as odd was the source—the galactic center being utterly devoid of life—and the means of transmission. The messages were not sent via supraluminal communications, but instead broadcast on ancient radio frequencies. That meant the message had been sent thousands of years before the Lazax first founded their empire on Mecatol Rex. In the confused wake of the Creuss disaster, the galaxy’s network of data brokers began sharing stories of a wealthy individual who was hungry for information. Brokers rarely met with their new client in person, but the few who did said they were a nondescript humanoid wearing an environmental suit and shrouded in merchant’s garb. They referred to themself only as “the Nomad,” and paid in valuable information as often as in coin. The Nomad seemed particularly interested in any information regarding the failed Creuss expedition, and about the scattered rumors of nightmare demons haunting Shaleri space. Some argued that the Nomad had to be a mask for members of a larger organization. Anyone could use an environmental suit to obscure their identity, after all. Others insisted that the Nomad was a single individual, even in the face of rumors that they had conducted business in several different star systems across the span of a few days. Still, most dismissed the Nomad as a harmless curiosity—until Sumerian. Space Station Sumerian encircles the frostbitten world of Arcturus. Though the ice-locked planet has few inhabitants save for the smugglers who hide caches of contraband on the surface, the massive station is one of the busiest independent trading ports in the galaxy. Laws are loose and enforcement lax, so one can buy nearly anything in one of Sumerian’s hundreds of markets and bazaars. Ships from every corner of the galaxy dock in its shipping bays, and the various galactic powers have traditionally left Sumerian alone while quietly skimming riches from the businesses conducted there. In the course of a few weeks, the Nomad took over Sumerian, seemingly by chance. A series of licenses, contracts, and deals ended and began at the perfect time to grant the Nomad control of the station’s operations and most of its major factions. The few magnates and mercenary leaders who attempted to resist the takeover simply vanished. The head of Sumerian, a trader by the name of Huro M’es, ended up being quietly arrested and imprisoned. With the Nomad in control of Sumerian, they began to expand their grasp over the surrounding systems. It quickly became apparent that the Nomad had access to nearly limitless sums of money, and they used their funds to buy influence in planetary governments and outright control of corporations. At the same time, mercenary groups began flocking to Sumerian, drawn by promises of lucrative contracts. Whole starships were purchased through shell corporations and eventually ended up in Sumerian docks, being refitted with military weapons and hardware. The Nomad also brought with them a small cadre of loyal agents that they seemed to trust to act in their name. The most feared of these was the Creuss warrior AhkSyl Siven, whose armor glowed with intermingled blue and crimson sparks. Many have since come to realize that the Nomad is the center of a creeping web of influence and blackmail that stretches across the galaxy, and at the same time has also amassed a formidable mercenary army. However, all attempts to covertly eliminate this nascent threat have thus far ended in failure. The Nomad seems to have an almost prescient ability to anticipate threats and defeat them. Whoever the Nomad is, they clearly are enacting a plan of mind-boggling scope and complexity. Now, as their agents infiltrate the Galactic Council and mercenary warships set out from Sumerian’s docks, many suspect that the ultimate goal of that plan is Mecatol Rex.</value>

  <data name="TheTitansOfUl_History" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Tens of thousands of years ago, Mahact gene-sorcerers crafted one of their most brilliant creations, the Titans. Though they looked like massive machines, beneath their metallic shells each Titan was a living creature of silicates and steel. They combined the best elements of the biological and the mechanical. They could work for days without tiring and were exceedingly durable. They could also heal injuries and, over time, expand their numbers. Most importantly, they were intelligent beings, not mindless automatons—though the Mahact programmed them so that the Titans would never disobey their masters. In all, the gene-sorcerers had created the perfect guardians and laborers for their kingdoms. When the Mahact were driven from the galaxy by the Lazax, they seeded sleepers in their wake to facilitate their eventual return. The greatest of these were to be the Titans. At the Mahact’s command, the Titans buried themselves in the wilds of their worlds and went into a deep dormancy. And they slept, as the Lazax Empire rose and fell, and the Twilight Wars raged and quieted. Occasionally, a Titan may be uncovered by explorers, but they appeared to be just one more relic of a forgotten past. Then the Mahact returned, and the gene-sorcerers sent out a call to awaken their servants. Many of the Titans heard the call and woke. However, the Mahact had gravely underestimated their creations. During their millennia of dormancy, the Titans had continued to develop, and their minds had continued to expand. When they woke, they found that they no longer felt any compulsion to obey their former masters. Instead, the Titans began to seek out others of their kind. The greatest population of Titans had gone dormant on one of the wonders they had constructed during the last days of the Mahact rule: a massive Dyson sphere. The Titans had constructed the shell around a singularity, using its harnessed energy for power, and its immense mass to create gravity on the outer surface. Now, they claimed their creation, calling it Elysium and summoning all other Titans to join them. In the years that followed, the Titans have worked hard to establish their new civilization. Elysium offers more space than ten thousand normal planets. This has proven invaluable, because though the Titans grow slowly, they never stop. The youngest Titans are easily ten meters tall, while an elder can be the size of a habitant tower. Titans also show a great preference for order and organization. They freely submit to a hierarchical society, where the oldest and most experienced Titan, called the “Ul,” rules. While the Titans are bio-mechanical creatures, they tend to show a great love of living things. Many Titans devote themselves to cultivating Elysium into a lush garden world, seeding myriad biomes across its formerly barren surface. Titan towns blend seamlessly with the surrounding landscape, even though Titan structures are massive by necessity. That said, since the Titans tend to spread out across Elysium’s surface, the only true city is their capital, Transcendence. Here one can find the Ul literally watching over their people. The eldest Titan is so massive that they eclipse even the largest buildings. Instead, the Ul stands in the center of Transcendence, unmoving while they speak with their fellows about the issues confronting their people. Though the Titans have been preoccupied with cultivating their new world and developing their society, they have not forgotten about the wider galaxy. Already trading vessels descend on Elysium with holds full of rare minerals and exotic plant and animal life. In exchange, the Titans construct wondrous devices from the ancient days, and travel to other worlds to build huge orbital stations and massive geoforming and terraforming projects. They continue to scour the galaxy, looking for any of their kin who may still slumber beneath the surfaces of countless worlds. As the ancient prophecies come to pass and war looms, the Ul looks into the skies of Elysium and sees a galaxy in chaos. They know that the only chance that teeming multitudes scattered across countless worlds have for survival is a steady hand guiding them to peace. They know that while some may not realize it, there is a place for everyone in the universe, and everyone must find their place—with the Titans to watch over them all.</value>

    <value>Most technological devices used in the galaxy today
have at least one or two components originating from
the Jol-Nar laboratories. During the height of the Lazax
Imperium, the galaxy was even more reliant on underlying
Jol-Nar technology and the knowledge of the aquatic
Hylar. This reliance on Jol-Nar engineers and skills was
one of the key factors leading to the total collapse of
galactic civilization and its descent into the Dark Years
that followed the Twilight Wars.
When the Twilight Wars first began, the Jol-Nar closed
their embassies, withdrew their workers, and started a war
of aggression on their own. Among the other races, few
individuals remained who now understood the complex
Jol-Nar machinery, virtual code, and chemical compounds.
Soon, fundamental machinery started failing, setting off a
chain reaction of integrated technological failures over a
period of hundreds of years. Combined with devastating
wars, this spurred massive famine, poverty, and chaos. As
cultures, economies, and finally the tools of war completely
collapsed, the Twilight Wars quickly ebbed and the Dark
Years began.
Even the Jol-Nar were devastated by the Twilight
Wars. Although the rest of the galaxy had relied on their
technologies, so had the Jol-Nar relied on the income,
protection, and natural resources of others. The arrogance
of the High Scholars spurred them to wage a sudden
aggressive war after the Quann conflict erupted. Then,
a few years later, the Doolak plague destroyed nearly a
quarter of the Jol-Nar population, causing a massive loss
of knowledge by itself. The Jol-Nar aggression soon turned
defensive, and the powerful N’orr looked to conquer all
Jol-Nar space. Only after a decisive Jol-Nar victory in the
Saudor system did the Hylar receive a needed respite.
Like azure sapphires, the twin ocean planets of Jol
and Nar slowly circle the Garian star. Under their waters
lies the great civilization of the Hylar, a water-breathing,
soft-boned species with oversized heads and intellects to
match. The Hylar are governed by an ancient system of
high scholars, who combined are called the University.
A single Hylar ruler, the Headmaster, oversees the
Hylar from the deep underwater city of WunEscha on the planet of Jol. Under the Headmaster,
the Circle of Regents governs the local regions
and specific areas of knowledge.
Although the Hylar are often considered one
race, there are in fact several distinct variations
within the Hylar species, mainly derivative of the
geographical region and ocean
depth from which they hail.
Most Hylar are capable of breathing
surface air, and some can exist for
weeks without being submerged. Others
cannot breathe surface air at all, and must travel in massive
tanks when off-planet. None know how an underwater
race came to be masters of technology. Most agree that the
large bio-cerebral area of the Hylar physique, combined
with a need to adapt their soft-boned and slow bodies to
their environment, created an evolution of material usage,
as opposed to one of physical adaptation.
Despite their physical weakness, the Hylar are a proud
people, often to the point of abrasiveness and arrogance.
Since the catastrophic Dark Years, the Hylar have started
utilizing the natural resources of their own planets, and
they now extract metals and medicines from the many
algae and coral formations of both Jol and Nar. As a new
age nears, the Hylar once more strive for the influence they
feel they have earned. The Circle of Regents has secretly
decided that the Hylar must take the place of the Lazax
in governing and advancing a new united galaxy. Under
their mandate, the Headmaster has begun building his
forces, and Jol-Nar diplomats and engineers have started
appearing among the other civilizations in large numbers,
appearing friendly, but with hidden agendas. Soon the
Headmaster will make his claim for the empire, and the
galaxy will enter an age of technological advancement and
intellectual achievement.</value>

    <value>Philosophers and scientists have long theorized that the galaxy is only one of a host of realities. These other dimensions exist on a different plane, and the physical laws one takes for granted in this space—such as gravity and entropy—may be wildly different or nonexistent. The existence of fabled worlds like Mallice seems to support such conjectures, for the world may exist in one such alternate reality. Some researchers even attempt to predict the nature of these theoretical dimensions. However, even the most deranged scientist could not imagine a universe of seething, fleshy masses floating in a thick, cloying mist, or the ravenous creatures that could thrive in such a place. After the disaster on Acheron, a single Letnev corvette returned from the depths of Shaleri space with the horrifying tale of what had befallen the Creuss expedition to Ixth. As the various members of the Galactic Council began to gather their forces to deal with the Mahact, the Mentak Coalition dispatched one of its fastest void sloops to reconnoiter the Acheron system and see what the Mahact may be up to. After a week’s hard travel, the void sloop drifted quietly in past the Acheron system’s icy outer bodies and got its first good look at the gateway to Ixth. To the crew’s shock, the planet was no more. Acheron had shattered into shards of rock that now tumbled around an immense roiling vortex of gravitational instability that seethed with a baleful purple light. The vortex was in the midst of consuming the inner system. Even days out, the sloop’s commander could feel the strain on her vessel, and watched in horror as Acheron’s star twisted and writhed under the assault. But she pressed on, as close as she dared. There was no sign of the Mahact or the Creuss expeditionary armada. However, there were strange readings amongst the tumbling remnants of the planet. When one of the sensor returns suddenly accelerated toward her ship, the commander had her crew put about and fled for open space. That was the last successful expedition to the Acheron system. In the months following the event, researchers and intelligence operatives began to make conjectures about what new threat had fallen on the galaxy. Ixth, supposed paradise and ancient home of the Mahact, sat far outside the bounds of the galaxy. In order to construct a gateway that could reach across the gulf of intergalactic space, the Mahact had to sink it deep into the very fabric of spacetime. As part of their entropic field research, the Naaz-Rokha theorized that the wormhole may have crossed the threshold of this universe, into an entirely different dimension. When the Mahact awoke, they ripped their world from its orbit and flung it into the galaxy’s heart. In doing so, they destroyed the Acheron Gateway, leaving a great gaping wound in the planet’s heart and in the fabric of the universe. Through this rift came the Vuil’raith—a race of creatures from beyond the stars, resembling the demons that haunt many of the galaxy’s oldest myths. No two are alike, and they range in size from tiny monsters no larger than a finger to great fleshy beasts as large as dreadnoughts that swim through the void. They have infested the twisted space around the bones of Acheron. From there they gather their forces and cast their covetous eyes upon the galaxy. The Vuil’raith are not mindless monsters. They possess a malign intelligence and powerful ambitions. They are even led by a Cabal, though the council has no set size. If a Vuil’raith is vicious and powerful enough to slay all of its rivals, eventually it amasses enough power to join the Cabal’s ranks. It remains a part of the Cabal as long as it can dominate a significant horde of lesser Vuil’raith and keep its foes from slaying it to lay claim to its holdings. However, there are no true allies in the Cabal; only mutually distrusted rivals bound by shared interests. The Cabal has set out to sow dissension ahead of its invasion. Cults of the Vuil’raith fester in the shadows of the galaxy’s great cities. The weak-willed and disaffected are drawn to serve the Cabal, some with the hope of reaping grand rewards, while others simply want to watch the galaxy burn. The Vuil’raith send their agents to advance their interests and weaken their foes, and even the halls of the Galactic Council may not be free of their taint. Meanwhile, the worlds on the edges of Shaleri space have come under assault from the Vuil’raith. Looming flesh-ships smash system defense fleets from the void, and crackling portals open in the streets to disgorge hordes of ravenous demon-beasts. With the Acheron rift providing an anchor into this reality, the Vuil’raith work tirelessly to build additional gateways to their hellish domain, their only desire to rip open the heart of Mecatol Rex and set a gateway amongst its bones.</value>

  <data name="TheWinnu_History" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Winnu system was the first system to seek annexation
into the Lazax Empire. Throughout their history, the Winnarans
had suffered countless civil wars, a deteriorating climate, and
debilitating disease. They were a race on the brink of extinction
when they first came into contact with the Lazax, and only with
generous Lazax support did the Winnaran race survive. The
Lazax allowed the Winnarans into their empire, and over time
healed the scars of Winnu. More importantly, the Winnarans
came to embrace the Lazax code of strength and peace, the
powerful doctrine which had allowed the first Lazax emperor
to defeat the last of the mad Mahact kings and to emerge as a
shining beacon of peace and stability in a dark galaxy.
The Winnarans were eternally grateful to the Lazax, and
swore an oath of servitude to the emperors. Disciplined and
diligent, the Winnarans became indispensable to the Lazax as
bureaucrats, councilors, and administrators. As their empire
grew increasingly complex, it is likely that the Lazax would not
have been able to hold their empire together without the work
and attention to detail of the Winnarans. Then, as the Lazax
decided to move their imperial seat to a planet more central to
the galaxy, more than half of the population of Winnu joined
the Lazax diaspora to this new home. That home was the
planet of Mecatol, which would become the Rex, the splendid
jewel in the imperial crown. As the ages came and went, most
Winnarans began to think of Mecatol as their ancestral home,
and the relevance and memory of Winnu and their brethren
there diminished.
Yet the Winnaran population on Winnu, now generally
called the “Winnu,” quietly built their own civilization following
the doctrine of the emperors. Much Lazax lore, wisdom, and
culture is intact on Winnu, even as all other Lazax imagery
and culture was destroyed elsewhere in the galaxy during the
Great Scourge.
As the memory of the Great Scourge faded, and as the
Dark Years seemed to stretch along endlessly, the Mecatol
Winnarans and the Winnu grew estranged from one another.
On Mecatol, the Winnarans were bound to rigid tradition
and scholarship, while the Winnu culture had evolved and
prospered. The Winnu became ashamed of their submissive
cousins on Mecatol, whom they began to regard as a grey,
backwards people, devoid of fashion, art, and culture.
As a new age is dawning, the Winnu truly believe themselves
to be the inheritors of the Lazax. Their philosophies, their
artwork, and even the clothing fashion of the Winnu is rooted
in that of the ancient Lazax. Some outside observers, however,
will note that along with the Winnu preservation of Lazax
imagery and culture, that time has brought the return of more
traditional Winnaran traits in the Winnu—ambition, pride,
and impatience.
As they grew prosperous and powerful, the Winnu witnessed
the reemergence of the other great races with annoyance and
mistrust. Those were the races that had slaughtered their
benefactors, and their return to power felt to the Winnu like
sacrilege against the memory of the Lazax. Even more poisonous
to the Winnu was the fact that their submissive cousins on
Mecatol had invited these
races to reestablish the
Galactic Council there—even
going as far as inviting the races
that resigned from the Lazax council
immediately before the Age of Twilight.
With the pride of a new, powerful civilization and the sense
of Lazax entitlement, the supreme Winnu leader Muab Di
Faruuq traveled to Mecatol and demanded that the Winnarans
return to the sovereignty of Winnu, and that the custodians
grant the Imperial Throne to their own race as the rightful
heirs of the Lazax.
The Mecatol Winnarans, ever mindful of their responsibility
to the entire galaxy, sorrowfully declined the demand of their
brethren. As they did so, they feared that their short-tempered
Winnu brothers and sisters would become angered, and that
the resulting bitterness would forever break apart whatever
kinship remained between them.
The Winnarans’ fear was well placed. Muad Di Faruuq was
furious with their decision and rushed back to Winnu, but not
before establishing a consulate and council presence for the
Winnu on Mecatol. Upon his return to Winnu, he proclaimed
the betrayal of the Winnarans, and swore that if Mecatol and
the Imperial Throne would not be ceded to the Winnu by
peaceful means, then, in the memory of the Lazax, force would
be the only answer.
The Winnu population rushed to Faruuq’s support, a sense
of righteousness and superiority motivating them to an intense
mobilization. Building massive fleets, eerily reminiscent of
ancient Lazax designs, and training massive invasion forces, the
Winnu are intent on returning true Lazax culture to the galaxy</value>

  <data name="TheXxchaKingdom_History" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Even the oldest annals recognize the ancient kingdom
of the reptilian Xxcha as the first of the great interstellar
civilizations. Nestled in the middle of a wealthy section of
space, the Xxcha twin planets of Archon Ren and Archon
Tau lie bathed in the gentle light of the Xxlak star. While
the Xxcha still call the two planets “twins,” an outsider will
instantly notice that the grayish and shadowy Archon Tau in
no way resembles the brilliant, healthy green of Archon Ren.
Throughout the tenure of the lost Lazax Imperium, the
Xxcha were the most peaceful, docile, and content of the
major civilizations. They did not, unlike the other races,
scheme for power and territory during the Age of Dusk.
Unlike the Lazax, the Xxcha elders did see the growing threat
to the galaxy. They fruitlessly sought to warn the Lazax of
their peril, and struggled to bring dialogue to the increasing
racial factionalism. A powerful Lazax councilor by the name
of Ibna Vel Syd listened to the Xxcha warning, but even he
could not sway the false sense of safety felt by the emperor.
Then, disaster struck. The Quann crisis erupted into sudden
war, and the Letnev, led by the Baron Daz Arrokan I, moved
towards the rich Xxcha system in conquest. The Xxcha,
unprepared and weaponless, used their formidable powers
of negotiation and goodwill to broker an agreement in
which they ceded only Archon Tau to the invaders, while the
kingdom retained a Letnev-supervised autonomy on Archon
Ren. The Xxcha, never fools, were aware of the nature of
Letnev promises and the futility of the arrangement. The
agreement would only last as long as the Barony was occupied
in war elsewhere. In time, the Xxcha knew, the Letnev would
return to claim the rest of their prize and enslave them. It was
then, for the first time in their history, that the Xxcha started
to create their first weapons and train their first armies. In
secret deep groves and in hidden vales, the Xxcha king sadly
watched his people develop into warriors.
Less than a decade after the occupation of Archon Tau,
the Letnev fleet suffered a stunning defeat against Sol in
the Gral system. Only a few cycles after the battle, the Sol
Phoenix fleet entered the Xxlak system and engaged the
heavily fortified Letnev positions on Archon Tau. The
ensuing bombardments and battles lasted for almost two
years. In the end, the Letnev occupiers were defeated,
but with a terrible toll. The ecology of Archon Tau had
been shattered beyond recall. What was once a true
twin to the green and fruitful Archon Ren was now
a noxious, blackened crater. Its forests had burned.
Ashes and scattered dust started a planet-wide
winter that lasted for a hundred years, killing most
plant and animal life.
Now, recovered from the loss of Archon Tau,
the Xxcha kingdom has prospered on the generous
Archon Ren. Covered by mostly leafy forests, small
inland oceans, and fruitful jungles, Archon Ren is rich
in minerals, energy, foodstuffs, and water. The Xxcha
civilization dwells in a
myriad of arboreal villages
and towns. The only true
metropolis is the giant city of
Kklaj, found on the planet’s southern
hemisphere. Kklaj functions as the seat
of the Xxcha King, whose extensive palace, entirely sculpted
of Q’waar wood, and flower gardens, stretch for miles at the
center of the city.
The Xxcha are an inherently peaceful, slow, and thoughtful
people. They hold their nobles and town elders in deep
respect. A common pastime of Xxcha males and females alike
is to debate meaning and origin while smoking gerr root on
long-stemmed pipes. The jungles and lakes of Archon Ren
are surprisingly free from the invasive insects that so often
make forest and jungle planets unbearable.
Although the Xxcha still believe in the doctrine of
peace and negotiation, they will never again bend to
foreign invasion. Travelers to the Xxlak system will often
notice impressive sentinel Xxcha superdreadnoughts and
the distinctive Xxlun fighters in intense naval exercises.
Although the typical Xxcha may seem slow and encumbered
by a heavy reptilian bodily weight, when roused, the Xxcha
are surprisingly strong and fast.
The pale shadow of Archon Tau hangs like a scar in
the Xxcha skies. The sight of it is the everlasting sorrow
of the Xxcha, and the ever-present reminder of the cost of
submission. The Xxcha will never allow such tragedy to befall
them again. Ccrysus, the Xxcha King, knows that for the sake
of a peaceful galaxy, the Xxcha must seek the Imperial Throne
and be wise for all.</value>

    <value>Lazax law strictly forbade the practice of cloning, the
dangerous science that led to the madness, disease, and
ultimate downfall of the Mahact kings. The emperors severely
punished any regime or independent scientist dabbling in this
dangerous field.
Darien Van Hauge, a prominent Sol scientist, had lost both
his children to the terrible wasting disease Greyfire. After their
loss, he was intent on finding a cure for this horrible affliction,
and refused to let any law stay his hand. In silent revenge
against the destiny of his children, he left his employment with
the prestigious Hospitaler Clinic in New Moscow and traveled
to the third moon of Emelpar, where he secretly sought and
finally acquired ancient Mahact bio studies.
The brilliant Darien made great advances in the following
years. His wife Moyin contributed the embryos he needed
for his forbidden experiments. With his successes, however,
word of his work began to leak, and a congregation of the
hopeful began to surround him, bringing their sick and dying
to his care, clinging to a last hope that his discoveries could
cure them.
Darien’s secret ended the day a sick child died in his care.
The anguished, remorseful parents blamed Darien for the
death and contacted the Sol authorities. That night, Darien fled
Jord with his wife and a few of his most devout followers.
Now a known fugitive, Darien narrowly escaped capture
again and again. To finally escape the Lazax authorities, his
small group joined religious colonists migrating to a new home
on the remote planet of Lael, a place of harsh oceans and stormy
climates. Their fugitive years brought healing and perspective
on the death of their children, and Darien and Moyin found
happiness again on the windy plains of Lael.
But a few years later, Moyin developed Greyfire.
Desperate to save his wife, Darien employed all his skills
and forbidden knowledge, but still he failed. Before her death,
he extracted a single egg from her womb—preserving the
genetic blueprint of her unborn children.
He burned her body on the summit of the Hills of Grace,
which they had named after their lost daughter. As Moyin’s
ashes drifted upwards into the strong winds, Darien dug a
stone out of the hillside with his bare hands and placed it
near the fire. That stone was to become part of the foundation
for the great monastery of Lucas, named after Darien and
Moyin’s lost son.
In the following decades, Darien was able to produce a
child from a clone of Moyin’s egg and his own seed. It was a
boy. Cloning Moyin’s egg by the thousands, producing child
after child with increasing success, Darien became a master of
the forbidden craft. Yet, inexplicably to him, all the children
were boys, and he was never able to eradicate the vulnerability
to Greyfire from his creation. Though he was able to eliminate
the lethal outcome of the disease in his “sons” as he called
them, the Greyfire would attack their skins and topical tissues,
hideously deforming most of the children.
After Darien’s death, his
sons diligently continued his
work. They continued cloning
Moyin’s egg, which they called
the “Yin,” and they continued the
production of new “brothers” from their
own seed. Over the centuries, the monastery of Lucas became
a vast facility, completely covering the Hills of Grace and the
surrounding plains.
The Brotherhood, blessed with the brilliant minds of both
Darien and Moyin, grew to vast proportions and renamed
their planet “Darien.” As the Age of Dusk neared its end, the
Brotherhood ventured into space, establishing monasteries on
Darien’s moons and its surrounding systems.
The Brotherhood long ago abandoned any hope of a female
creation, and instead worship the Yin as the mother and the
feminine in their lives. Despite centuries of continued work,
they have never been able to completely eradicate the signs
of Greyfire. Instead, the brothers that are completely ravaged
and deformed by the disease are revered as “The Blessed,”
and the brothers left untouched by the disease are called “The
Untouched.” The Blessed form the inner elders and councilors
of the Yin society. The Untouched are trained as ambassadors
to the other races and as elite soldiers of the Brotherhood.
In their flesh, the brothers carry the secret inner fire and
rebellious ambition of Darien. The oldest of the Blessed,
the Elder Brother, intimately understands the emotions
and aspirations of all his brothers. Intent and unified, the
Brotherhood now builds a vast fleet with which to bring
Darien’s legacy and the light of Yin to the imperial throne itself.</value>

    <value>Near the Mahact Plateau, diagonally opposite the Passage
of Tears, but located in a far richer area of the region, shines
the Myock star and its two habitable planets, Shalloq and
Retillion. As recorded in even the earliest annals, Retillion
has been known for the edible and delicious menn root.
Throughout the Lazax Imperium, many farming colonies
existed on Retillion, harvesting the roots along the musky
and odorous shores of the Fianni swamps. In the years of
Lazax emperor Munhan Las Idu, the colonization efforts were
dramatically expanded. Not long after the start of the farming
expansion, however, things started to go terribly wrong on
Retillion: farm machines were sabotaged, isolated farms
destroyed, inhabitants murdered by an unseen foe that would
strike when the bog mists rolled over the lands.
The empire sent reinforcements, and the colonists soon
realized that they were under systematic attack by a small
native chameleon race with natural greenish skin and large
yellow lamp-like eyes. These aborigines had the ability to
“fade,” making them both virtually invisible to the naked
eye and a great threat to the farming boom towns springing
up along the edges of the measureless swamps. It was clear
that the natives were a primitive race, but fierce, intelligent,
and relentless in their intent to stop the invasive farming of
their native swamplands. From the few early prisoners, it was
learned that they called themselves the “Yssaril” and that a
vast network of villages and tribes was to be found in the
continent-sized Fianni swamp.
Eager to renew the supplies of their beloved menn
root, the Lazax sent their 21st Expeditionary Division to
suppress the Yssaril uprising, allowing for the resumption
of the increased farming mandate. During these bloody
years, thousands of Yssaril were captured and shipped to
governments and buyers across the galaxy for study or
hunting sports. Although farming did resume, the Lazax
military division never completely suppressed the Yssaril
natives. As the small green Yssaril adapted to the Lazax style
of warfare, as they stole and learned to use Lazax weapons,
the Fianni swamp soon became an embarrassing killing field
for Lazax conscripts.
It was during the Age of Dusk that the great races learned
to utilize the potential of the intelligent Yssaril as spies
and assassins for their covert operations. For a hundred
years, the Yssaril learned the skills of stealth, the
usage of technologies, and the power of information.
Combined with their own natural ability to become
nearly invisible, they soon came to realize their own
potential and established the powerful and feared
Guild of Spies. By the proceeds derived from Guild
business, the Yssaril added a formidable income
source to their civilization and to the development
of Retillion. With this power and influence, they were
able to convince the Lazax to leave the planet (while still
supplying menn root). Over a few generations, the Yssaril
became industrial, educated, and ambitious.
Although still powerful
in covert circles, the Guild
now functions as the prime
governing body of the united
Yssaril tribes. The Guild elects
its leader from its faction of master
assassins. This prime leader, the Cqaark, leads the powerful
civilization of an intelligent, determined, and ambitious
people: a people whose history has left them with little love
for the other great races.
Since the Lazax left, no off-worlders have been allowed
on Retillion. The Yssaril capital Wuecca lies somewhere
deep in the Fianni swamps, its actual location unknown to
all but the Yssaril. The official business, trade, and covert
operations are conducted from the planet Shalloq, which the
Yssaril colonized not long after gaining independence from
the Lazax. The only actual Yssaril city known to off-worlders
is the city of Mojeb on Shalloq. From here, or from Shalloq’s
great orbital trade station Haarsuh, the Yssaril receive foreign
emissaries, merchants, and visitors.
The proud, fierce Yssaril are slowly starting to look
beyond their borders and beyond the income of the Guild.
Hidden in the planetary shadow of Shalloq, and kept secret
from the rest of the galaxy by the covert means at which the
Yssaril excel, a great invasion fleet is being built. Although
the rest of the galaxy may shudder at the Yssaril’s unseen eyes
and ears, it would be terrified if it knew the ruthless imperial
ambitions of the small green people.</value>
