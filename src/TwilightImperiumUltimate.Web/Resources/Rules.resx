    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Cards and faction sheets each have abilities that players can resolve to trigger various game effects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If information in this Rules Reference contradicts the Learn to Play booklet, the Rules Reference takes precedence.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a card ability contradicts information in the Rules Reference, the card takes precedence. If both the card and the rules can be followed at the same time, they should be.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each ability describes when and how a player can resolve it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If an ability with a specified duration is resolved, the effect of the ability remains through that duration, even if the component that caused the ability is removed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a card has multiple abilities, each ability is presented as its own paragraph.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an ability contains the word &amp;ldquo;Action&amp;rdquo; a player must use a component action during the action phase to resolve that ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an ability uses the word &amp;ldquo;cannot&amp;rdquo;, that effect is absolute.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If two abilities use the word &amp;ldquo;cannot&amp;rdquo;, a persistent ability takes precedence over a one&amp;ndash;time ability and an enabling ability takes precedence over a cancel ability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player resolves an ability, they must resolve the ability in its entirety. Any parts of the ability preceded by the word &amp;ldquo;may&amp;rdquo; are optional, and the player resolving the ability may choose not to resolve those parts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Abilities on components that remain in play are mandatory unless those abilities use the word &amp;ldquo;may&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an ability has multiple effects separated by the word &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo;, a player must resolve as many of the ability&amp;rsquo;s effects as possible. However, if the player cannot resolve all of its effects, that player is allowed to resolve as many as they can.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Costs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some abilities have a cost that is followed by an effect. The cost of an ability is separated from the effect by the word &amp;ldquo;to&amp;rdquo; or by a semicolon. A player cannot resolve the effect of such an ability if they cannot resolve that ability&amp;rsquo;s cost.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some examples of an ability&amp;rsquo;s cost include spending resources, spending trade goods, spending command tokens, exhausting cards, purging cards, and activating specific systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the timing of an ability uses the word &amp;ldquo;before&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;after&amp;rdquo;, the ability&amp;rsquo;s effect occurs immediately before or after the described timing event, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, if an ability is resolved &amp;ldquo;after a ship is destroyed&amp;rdquo;, the ability must be resolved as soon as the ship is destroyed and not later during that turn or round.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the timing of an ability uses the word &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo;, the ability&amp;rsquo;s effect occurs at the moment of the described timing event.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Such an ability typically modifies or replaces the timing event in some way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Effects that occur &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo; an event happens take priority over effects that occur &amp;ldquo;after&amp;rdquo; an event happens.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an ability uses the word &amp;ldquo;then&amp;rdquo;, a player must resolve the effect that occurs before the word &amp;ldquo;then&amp;rdquo; or they cannot resolve the effect that occurs after the word &amp;ldquo;then&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each ability can be resolved once for each occurrence of that ability&amp;rsquo;s timing event. For example, if an ability is resolved &amp;ldquo;at the start of combat&amp;rdquo;, it can be resolved at the start of each combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If there are multiple abilities that players wish to resolve at the same time during the &lt;b&gt;action phase&lt;/b&gt;, each player takes a turn resolving an ability in initiative order, beginning with the active player. This process continues until each player has resolved each ability that they wish to resolve during that window.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If there are multiple abilities that players wish to resolve at the same time during the &lt;b&gt;strategy&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;agenda phases&lt;/b&gt;, players take turns resolving abilities starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise. This process continues until each player has resolved each ability that they wish to resolve during that window.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Component&amp;ndash;specific Rules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The opening paragraph of each ability found on an action card describes when a player can resolve that card&amp;rsquo;s ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The opening paragraph of most abilities found on promissory notes describes when a player can resolve that card&amp;rsquo;s ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some promissory notes have abilities that trigger as soon as a player receives the card.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Abilities on agenda cards correspond to an outcome. Players resolve these abilities during the agenda phase after players vote for a particular outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each faction has faction abilities presented on its faction sheet. Each faction&amp;rsquo;s flagship has one or more unique abilities. Some abilities provide players with perpetual effects.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some units have unit abilities. These abilities are named and presented above a unit&amp;rsquo;s attributes on a player&amp;rsquo;s faction sheet or on a unit upgrade card. Each unit ability has unique rules for when a player can resolve that ability. The following abilities are unit abilities:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;sc&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/sc&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;sc&gt;Deploy&lt;/sc&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;sc&gt;Planetary Shield&lt;/sc&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a unit&amp;rsquo;s ability uses the phrase &amp;ldquo;this system&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;this planet&amp;rdquo;, the ability is referring to the system or planet that contains that unit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>

  <data name="RuleCategory_Abilities_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An ability may be triggered during the timing window it was gained, if applicable. For example, if a player receives the Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Creuss Iff&lt;/i&gt; promissory note at the start of their turn, they may use it immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Note that some triggers check their conditions when they trigger, while some check their conditions when they would resolve.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The Ul player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Awaken&lt;/sc&gt; ability is an example of an ability that checks its condition when it triggers; activating a system without a sleeper token will not trigger &lt;sc&gt;Awaken&lt;/sc&gt;, even if a sleeper token is later added.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Assault Cannon&lt;/i&gt; technology is an example of an ability that checks its condition when it would resolve; a player without three or more non&amp;ndash;fighter ships in the system cannot use &lt;i&gt;Assault Cannon&lt;/i&gt;, even if they previously had more ships.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An ability from a single physical object cannot be resolved more than once in one timing window. For example, if a player starts their turn with the Creuss player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Creuss Iff&lt;/i&gt; promissory note in their hand (having received it on a previous turn) and uses it, they will not be able to used it a second time this turn, if they receive it as part of a transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each unit on the board is its own separate physical object. For example, two of the N&amp;rsquo;orr player&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Exotrireme II&lt;/i&gt; in a system may use their ability to destroy themselves and other ships, even though that ability is printed on a single technology card.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Multiple action cards with the same name cannot be played during a single timing window to affect the same units or game effect. See the Action cards page for more details.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the action phase, abilities are resolved in the current relative turn order, starting with the active player. For example, if it is currently the &lt;i&gt;Trade&lt;/i&gt; (5) player&amp;rsquo;s turn, they will have the option to resolve first, then the &lt;i&gt;Warfare&lt;/i&gt; (6) player, then the &lt;i&gt;Technology&lt;/i&gt; (7) player, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a player has multiple abilities they wish to resolve, they must be resolved one at a time. Between each ability being resolved, each other player will have the opportunity to resolve one ability.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;For example, Alice, the active player, wishes to resolve four abilities during the current timing window. Bob, the next player in order, wishes to resolve one. Cheng, later in the order, wishes to resolve two. The order of resolution would be: Alice &amp;num;1; Bob &amp;num;1; Cheng &amp;num;1; Alice &amp;num;2; Cheng &amp;num;2; Alice &amp;num;3; Alice &amp;num;4.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Once every player has consecutively declined to resolve an ability during a timing window, no more abilities may be resolved during that window.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player may decline to resolve an ability during a timing window, but later chose to resolve an ability during that same timing window, but only if another player chooses to resolve an ability after the player declined.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Following on from the above example, had Alice declined to resolve &amp;ldquo;Alice &amp;num;2&amp;rdquo;, she could still resolve &amp;ldquo;Alice &amp;num;3&amp;rdquo;, as Cheng resolved &amp;ldquo;Cheng &amp;num;2&amp;rdquo;, breaking the series of consecutive declinations. However, if Alice had instead declined to resolve &amp;ldquo;Alice &amp;num;3&amp;rdquo;, she would be unable to resolve &amp;ldquo;Alice &amp;num;4&amp;rdquo;, as then each player would have consecutively declined to resolve an ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The secondary abilities of strategy cards are resolved in clockwise order, after the primary ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may resolve &amp;ldquo;at the start of your turn&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;at the end of your turn&amp;rdquo; abilities on the turn that they pass.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All abilities that occur &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo; an event occurs all trigger before any abilities that occur &amp;ldquo;after&amp;rdquo; the same event occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All abilities that occur &amp;ldquo;after&amp;rdquo; an event occurs all trigger before any abilities that occur &amp;ldquo;before&amp;rdquo; the next event occurs.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_ActionCards" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Action cards provide players with various abilities that they can resolve as described on the cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each player draws one action card during each status phase.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players can draw action cards by resolving the primary and secondary abilities of the &lt;i&gt;Politics&lt;/i&gt; strategy card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player draws an action card, they take the top card from the action card deck and add it to their hand of action cards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each player&amp;rsquo;s hand can have a maximum of &lt;b&gt;seven action cards&lt;/b&gt;. If a player ever has more than seven action cards, that player must choose seven cards to keep and discard the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A game effect can increase or decrease the number of cards a player&amp;rsquo;s hand can have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player&amp;rsquo;s action cards remain hidden from other players until those cards are played.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The first paragraph of each action card is presented in bold text and describes the timing of when that card&amp;rsquo;s ability can be resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If an action card contains the word &amp;ldquo;Action&amp;rdquo;, a player must use a component action during the action phase to resolve the ability. A player cannot resolve a component action if they cannot completely resolve its ability.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Multiple action cards with the &lt;b&gt;same&lt;/b&gt; name cannot be played during a single timing window to affect the same units or game effect. Canceled cards are not treated as being played.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To play an action card, a player reads and resolves the card&amp;rsquo;s ability text, making any decisions as prompted by the card. Then, that player discards the card, placing it in the action discard pile.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an action card is canceled, that card has no effect and is discarded.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_ActionCards_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players start the game with zero action cards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may choose to reveal any or all of the action cards in their hand, if they so choose.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the action card deck is depleted, immediately shuffle the discard pile to form a new action card deck.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the action phase, action cards are dealt out in initiative order.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player&amp;rsquo;s action card is cancelled, usually via a &lt;i&gt;Sabotage&lt;/i&gt; action card, then if that player has a second copy of that action card, they may play it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot target themselves with offensive action cards, such as &lt;i&gt;Lucky Shot&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an action card targets &amp;ldquo;any number&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;up to&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;each&amp;rdquo; of a particular type of object, that action card may target zero of those objects. As such, these cards may be played even if they would cause no effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an action card targets a specific number of a particular type of object, that action card cannot be played if those objects do not currently exist. For example, &lt;i&gt;Repeal Law&lt;/i&gt; cannot be played if there are no laws in play.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player has more than seven action cards, they must discard the excess immediately. They cannot play them to get down to seven, and the Hacan player cannot trade them.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_ActionPhase" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;During the action phase, each player takes a turn in initiative order. During a player&amp;rsquo;s turn, they perform a single action. After each player has taken a turn, player turns begin again in initiative order. This process continues until all players have passed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During a player&amp;rsquo;s turn, they may perform one of the following three types of actions: a strategic action, a tactical action, or a component action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player cannot perform an action, they must pass.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After a player has passed, they have no further turns and cannot perform additional actions during that action phase.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;During a turn that a player passes, they can resolve transactions and &amp;ldquo;at the start of your turn&amp;rdquo; abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player that has passed can still resolve the secondary ability of other players&amp;rsquo; strategy cards.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;It is possible for a player to perform multiple, consecutive actions during an action phase if all other players have passed during that action phase.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot pass until they have performed the strategic action of their strategy card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During a three&amp;ndash;player or four&amp;ndash;player game, a player cannot pass until they have exhausted both of their strategy cards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Agenda cards represent galactic laws and policies. During each agenda phase, players cast votes for specific outcomes on two agenda cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There are two types of agenda cards: laws and directives.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Laws can permanently change the rules of the game.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When resolving a law, if a &amp;ldquo;For&amp;rdquo; outcome received the most votes, or if the law requires an election, the law&amp;rsquo;s ability becomes a permanent part of the game. Players resolve the outcome and place the agenda card either in the common play area or in a player&amp;rsquo;s play area, as dictated by the card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a law is in a player&amp;rsquo;s play area as opposed to the common play area, that player owns that law.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a law is discarded from play, that law&amp;rsquo;s ability is no longer in effect. Place that card on the top of the agenda card discard pile.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an &amp;ldquo;Against&amp;rdquo; outcome of a law received the most votes, players resolve the outcome and discard the agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Directives provide one&amp;ndash;time game effects.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When resolving a directive, players resolve the outcome that received the most votes and discard the agenda card.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_AgendaPhase" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;During the agenda phase, players can cast votes on agendas that can change the rules of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players skip the agenda phase during the early portion of each game. After the custodians token is removed from Mecatol Rex, the agenda phase is added to each game round. To resolve the agenda phase, players perform the following steps:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1 &amp;ndash; First Agenda&lt;/b&gt;: Players resolve the first agenda by following these steps in order:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol class="roman"&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reveal Agenda&lt;/b&gt;: The speaker draws one agenda card from the top of the agenda deck and reads it aloud to all players, including all of its possible outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vote&lt;/b&gt;: Each player, starting with the player to the left of the speaker and continuing clockwise, can cast votes for an outcome of the current agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resolve Outcome&lt;/b&gt;: Players tally each vote that was cast and resolve the outcome that received the most votes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2 &amp;ndash; Second Agenda&lt;/b&gt;: Players repeat the &lt;b&gt;First Agenda&lt;/b&gt; step of this phase for a second agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3 &amp;ndash; Ready Planets&lt;/b&gt;: Each player readies each of their exhausted planets. Then, a new game round begins starting with the strategy phase.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Voting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When voting during the agenda phase, a player can cast votes for a specific outcome of an agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To cast votes, a player exhausts any number of their planets and chooses an outcome. The number of votes cast for that outcome is equal to the combined influence values of the planets that the player exhausts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When a player exhausts a planet to cast votes, that player must cast the full amount of votes provided by that planet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot cast votes for multiple outcomes of the same agenda. Each vote a player casts must be for the same outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some agendas have &amp;ldquo;For&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Against&amp;rdquo; outcomes. When a player casts votes on such an agenda, that player must cast their votes either &amp;ldquo;For&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Against&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some agendas instruct players to elect either a player or a planet. When a player casts votes for such an agenda, that player must cast their vote for an eligible player or planet as described on the agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When electing a player, a player can cast votes for themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When resolving these agendas, the &amp;ldquo;elected player&amp;rdquo; is the player for whom the most votes are cast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When electing a planet, a player must cast votes for a planet that is controlled by a player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When resolving these agendas, the &amp;ldquo;elected planet&amp;rdquo; is the planet that had the most votes cast for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When casting votes, a player must declare aloud the outcome for which their votes are being cast.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Trade goods cannot be spent to cast votes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may choose to abstain by not casting any votes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some game effects allow a player to cast additional votes for an outcome. These votes cannot be cast for a different outcome than other votes cast by that player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player cannot vote on an agenda because of a game effect, that player cannot cast votes for that agenda by exhausting planets or through any other game effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outcomes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To resolve an outcome, the speaker follows the instructions on the agenda card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If there is a tie for the outcome that received the most votes, or if no outcome receives any votes, the speaker decides which of the tied outcomes to resolve.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The speaker&amp;rsquo;s decision is not a vote.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an &amp;ldquo;Elect&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;For&amp;rdquo; outcome of a law was resolved, that card remains in play and permanently affects the game.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a directive or an &amp;ldquo;Against&amp;rdquo; outcome of a law was resolved, that card is placed in the agenda discard pile.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some game effects instruct a player to predict an outcome. To predict an outcome, a player declares aloud the outcome they think will receive the most votes. That player must make this prediction after the agenda is revealed but before any votes have been cast.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A predicted outcome must be a possible outcome of the revealed agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;After resolving the outcome of the agenda, any abilities that were dependent upon predicting the outcome are resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_AgendaPhase_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot cast zero votes for an outcome. Casting zero votes is the same as abstaining.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player casts votes during the agenda phase, it is not that player&amp;rsquo;s turn for the purpose of game effects.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an agenda outcome affects multiple players, it does so in speaker order.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Riders are resolved after the agenda is fully resolved, in speaker order.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player successfully predicts multiple riders, they resolve one at a time, in the order that player chooses, with each other player having the opportunity to resolve an ability between each.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each pair of players may resolve one transaction during each agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Only planets ready at the end of the phase. Technologies, leaders, relics, and other cards do not.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;An anomaly is identified by a red border located on the tile&amp;rsquo;s corners.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There are four types of anomalies: asteroid fields, nebulae, supernovas, and gravity rifts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some anomalies contain planets; those systems are still anomalies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each type of anomaly is identified by its art. See rulebook for images.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Abilities can cause a system tile to become an anomaly; that system tile is an anomaly in addition to its other properties.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Abilities can cause a system to be two different anomalies; that system has the properties of both anomalies.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1&lt;/b&gt;: Each player rolls dice for each of their units in the combat that has the &lt;sc&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/sc&gt; ability; this is called an anti&amp;ndash;fighter barrage roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/sc&gt; value.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A unit&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/sc&gt; ability is presented along with a unit&amp;rsquo;s attributes on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect anti&amp;ndash;fighter barrage rolls.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This ability can still be used if no fighters are present; hits produced may be used to trigger specific abilities.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a player has to assign more hits than they have fighters in the active system, the excess hits have no effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;A unit with the &lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt; ability may be able to destroy another player&amp;rsquo;s ground forces during an invasion. During the &lt;b&gt;Bombardment&lt;/b&gt; step, players perform the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; The active player chooses which planet each of their units that has a &lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt; ability will bombard. Then, that player rolls dice for each of those units; this is called a bombardment roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt; value.&lt;/li&gt;

The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all &lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt; abilities have a (Y) value; a bombardment roll for such a unit consists of one die.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect bombardment rolls.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Multiple planets in a system may be bombarded, but a player must declare which planet a unit is bombarding before making a bombardment roll.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The L1Z1X&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Harrow&lt;/sc&gt; ability does not affect the L1Z1X player&amp;rsquo;s own ground forces.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Planets that contain a unit with the &lt;sc&gt;Planetary Shield&lt;/sc&gt; ability cannot be bombarded.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; The player who controls the planet that is being bombarded chooses and destroys one of their ground forces on that planet for each hit result the bombardment roll produced.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a player has to assign more hits than that player has ground forces, the excess hits have no effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Capacity is an attribute of some units that is presented on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A unit&amp;rsquo;s capacity value indicates the maximum combined number of fighters and ground forces that it can transport.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The combined capacity values of a player&amp;rsquo;s ships in a system determine the number of fighters and ground forces that player can have in that system&amp;rsquo;s space area.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player has more fighters and ground forces in the space area of a system than the total capacity of that player&amp;rsquo;s ships in that system, that player must remove the excess units.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player can choose which of their excess units to remove.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Ground forces on planets do not count against capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player&amp;rsquo;s fighters and ground forces do not count against capacity during combat. At the end of combat, any excess units are removed and returned to that player&amp;rsquo;s reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fighters and ground forces are not assigned to specific ships, except while they are being transported.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_Capacity_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player moves more fighters and/or ground forces into a system containing another player&amp;rsquo;s ships, capacity limits must be met before proceeding to the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; substep or the &lt;b&gt;Space Combat&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a ship with capacity is destroyed during the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; step, capacity limits must be met before space combat starts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Capacity is checked after the winner of a space combat is determined. As such, it is possible to win a space combat with only fighters remaining, before removing those fighters due to lack of capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ship cannot pick up more units from a planet than it has capacity. However, a ship may pick up any units (including zero) in a system as it transports, even if doing so would cause units to be removed due to capacity limits.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;For example, say a carrier (with capacity four) is in the space area of a system along with four fighters. On the only planet in that system are eight infantry. There are no other units in the system. When the carrier moves out of the system, it obeys the following:&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The carrier may transport the four fighters, leaving behind all eight of the infantry in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The carrier may transport four of the eight infantry, leaving behind the four remaining infantry in the system. Now that the system has zero capacity, all four of the fighters will be removed.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The carrier may transport two of the eight infantry and two of the four fighters, leaving behind the six remaining infantry in the system. Now that the system has zero capacity, the two remaining fighters will be removed.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The carrier may transport nothing, leaving behind all eight of the infantry in the system. Now that the system has zero capacity, all four of the fighters will be removed.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The carrier cannot attempt to pick up all eight infantry, even if it immediately removes four of them (and the fighters).&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;If a player is eliminated, any of their units that are captured remain with the player that captured them. When the capturing player would return them, the units are instead returned to the game box.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player has all of their units of one type on the game board or captured, and so have none in their reinforcements, and would place a unit of that type, they may remove a unit from any system on the game board that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that unit in their reinforcements, before placing that unit on the game board.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the action phase, a player can perform a tactical action by spending a command token from their tactic pool; they place the command token in a system.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Commodities represent goods that are plentiful for their own faction and are desired by other factions. A commodity has no inherent game effects, but converts into a trade good if given to or received from another player.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Commodities and trade goods are represented by opposite sides of the same token.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The commodity value on a player&amp;rsquo;s faction sheet indicates the maximum number of commodities that player can have.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When an effect instructs a player to replenish commodities, that player takes the number of commodity tokens necessary so that the amount of commodities that player has equals the commodity value on their faction sheet. Then, those tokens are placed faceup in the commodity area of that player&amp;rsquo;s faction sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player replenishes commodities, that player takes the commodity tokens from the supply.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players can trade commodities following the rules for transactions. When a player receives a commodity from another player, the player who received that token converts it into a trade good by placing it in the trade good area of their command sheet with the trade good side faceup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;That token is no longer a commodity token; it is a trade good token.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player can trade commodity tokens before resolving a game effect that allows them to replenish commodities.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a game effect instructs a player to convert a number of their own commodities to trade goods, those trade goods are not treated as being gained for the purpose of triggering other abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any game effect that instructs a player to give a commodity to another player causes that commodity to be converted into a trade good.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot spend commodities unless otherwise specified; a player can only trade them during a transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Commodity tokens come in values of one and three. A player can swap between these tokens as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_Commodities_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player starts the game with zero commodities.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player has their maximum number of commodities, and is instructed to replenish their commodities, they will take no commodities. However, they will still trigger any &amp;ldquo;when [this] player replenishes commodities&amp;rdquo; effects, most notably the &lt;i&gt;Trade Agreement&lt;/i&gt; promissory note.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>

  <data name="RuleCategory_ComponentAction" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;A component action is a type of action that a player can perform during their turn of an action phase.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Component actions can be found on various game components, including action cards, technology cards, leaders, exploration cards, relics, promissory notes, and faction sheets. Each component action is indicated by an &amp;ldquo;Action&amp;rdquo; header.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To perform a component action, a player reads the action&amp;rsquo;s text and follows the instructions as described.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A component action cannot be performed if its ability cannot be completely resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a component action is canceled, it does not use that player&amp;rsquo;s action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_ComponentAction_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;

    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_ComponentLimitations" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;If a component type is depleted during the game, players obey the following rules:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Dice: Dice are limitless. If a player needs to roll more dice than the game provides, that player should roll as many as possible, record the results, and then reroll dice as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Tokens: Tokens are limited to those included in the game, except for the following:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Control Tokens&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Fighter Tokens&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Trade Good Tokens&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Infantry Tokens&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If any of the above tokens are depleted, players can use a suitable substitute, such as a coin or bead.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Units: Units are limited to those included in the game, except for fighters and ground forces.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When a player would place a unit, if there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, that player can remove a unit from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that unit in their reinforcements. A player can remove any number of their units in this way; however, any units that are removed must be placed immediately. Abilities cannot force a player to remove and place a unit in this manner.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When producing a fighter or infantry unit, a player can use a fighter or infantry token, as appropriate, from the supply instead of a plastic piece. These tokens must be accompanied by at least one plastic piece of the same type; players can swap infantry and fighter tokens for plastic pieces at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Cards: When a deck is depleted, players shuffle the deck&amp;rsquo;s discard pile and place it facedown to create a new deck.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_ComponentLimitations_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;As each player only has ten plastic fighter figures and twelve plastic infantry figures, a player cannot have fighters in more than ten systems, and cannot have infantry on more than twelve planets or being carried in more than twelve space areas, or any combination thereof.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players may also swap infantry and fighter plastic pieces for tokens at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players may swap between three value tokens and one value tokens as desired.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may only resolve a deploy ability to place a unit that is in their reinforcements. A player cannot remove a unit from the board to use its deploy ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each faction has sixteen command and seventeen control tokens included in the game.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a discard pile is shuffled to form a new deck, any cards that have been purged are not included.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player removes a unit in order to place it, because they have none of that unit type in their reinforcements, that unit is placed undamaged.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player is instructed to &amp;ldquo;replace&amp;rdquo; one unit with another, and they have none of the replacement unit type in their reinforcements, they may remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that unit instead.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_Construction" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Construction&lt;/i&gt; strategy card allows players to construct structures on planets they control. This card&amp;rsquo;s initiative value is &amp;ldquo;4&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the action phase, if the active player has the &lt;i&gt;Construction&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card&amp;rsquo;s primary ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To resolve the primary ability on the &lt;i&gt;Construction&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, the active player may place either one PDS or one space dock on a planet they control. Then, that player may place an additional PDS on a planet they control.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The structures can be placed on the same planet or different planets.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The structures can be placed in any systems, regardless of whether the player has a command token in the system or not.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After the active player resolves the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Construction&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool and place that command token in any system. If that player already has a command token in that system, the spent token is returned to their reinforcements instead. Then, that player places either one PDS or one space dock on a planet they control in that system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player places either a PDS or space dock using the &lt;i&gt;Construction&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, they take that PDS or space dock from their reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a player does not have the unit in their reinforcements, that player can remove a unit from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that unit in their reinforcements. Then, that player must place the unit on the game board as instructed by the effect that is placing the unit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_Control" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Each player begins the game with control of each planet in their home system. During the game, players can gain control of additional planets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player gains control of a planet, they take the planet card that corresponds to that planet and place it in their play area; that card is exhausted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a player is the first player to control a planet, they take the planet card from the planet card deck.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If another player controls the planet, they take that planet&amp;rsquo;s card from the other player&amp;rsquo;s play area.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When a player gains control of a planet that is not already controlled by another player, they explore that planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot gain control of a planet that they already control.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;While a player controls a planet, that planet&amp;rsquo;s card remains in their play area until they lose control of that planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player can control a planet that they do not have any units on; that player places a control token on that planet to mark that they control it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player loses control of a planet if they no longer have units on it and another player has units on it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The player that placed units on the planet gains control of that planet.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;During the &lt;b&gt;Invasion&lt;/b&gt; step of a tactical action, control is determined during the &lt;b&gt;Establish Control&lt;/b&gt; step instead.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player can lose control of a planet through some game effects.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player loses control of a planet that contains their control token, they remove their control token from the planet.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_Cost" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Cost is an attribute of some units that is presented on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards. A unit&amp;rsquo;s cost determines the number of resources a player must spend to produce that unit.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To produce a unit, a player must spend a number of resources equal to or greater than the cost of the unit they are producing.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the cost is accompanied by two icons &amp;ndash; typically for fighters and ground forces &amp;ndash; a player produces two of that unit for that cost.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a unit does not have a cost, it cannot be produced.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Structures do not have costs and are usually placed by resolving the &lt;i&gt;Construction&lt;/i&gt; strategy card.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;The custodians token begins each game on Mecatol Rex. The token represents the caretakers that safeguard the seat of the empire until such time as the galactic council can be reconvened.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Units can move into the system that contains Mecatol Rex following normal rules; however, players cannot commit ground forces to land on Mecatol Rex until the custodians token is removed from the planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Before the &lt;b&gt;Commit Ground Forces&lt;/b&gt; step of an invasion, the active player can remove the custodians token from Mecatol Rex by spending six influence. Then, that player must commit at least one ground force to land on the planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a player cannot commit ground forces to land on Mecatol Rex, they cannot remove the custodians token.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_Deals" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;A deal is an agreement between two players that may or may not include a transaction that involves physical components.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players can make deals with each other at any time, even if they are not neighbors. However, deals that include a transaction must follow the rules for transactions, including that the players be neighbors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Deals are binding or non&amp;ndash;binding according to the conditions of the deal.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the terms of a deal can be resolved immediately, it is a binding deal. When a deal is binding, a player must adhere to the terms of the agreement and whatever transactions, if any, were agreed upon.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results of playing an action card, including the act of successfully resolving a card, are not instantaneous and cannot be guaranteed. They cannot be part of a binding deal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the terms of a deal cannot be resolved immediately, it is a non&amp;ndash;binding deal. When a deal is non&amp;ndash;binding, a player does not have to adhere to any part of the agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_Deals_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In general, only the terms of the deal that a player can immediately perform, even without the deal taking place, are binding. For example:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a player has four resources available during the &lt;b&gt;Production&lt;/b&gt; step of a tactical action, another player may give them four trade goods to on the condition that they produce a dreadnought during this &lt;b&gt;Production&lt;/b&gt; step. As the active player could produce a dreadnought with the resources, this deal is binding.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If instead the active player has zero resources available, the same deal would be non&amp;ndash;binding.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The following are further examples of non&amp;ndash;binding deals:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Making a deal to use a promissory note in a specific way, before the promissory note has been transacted.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Making a deal not make use of a unit&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability during a tactical action, before ships have been moved.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Making a deal to trade commodities in exchange for the active player to replenish another player&amp;rsquo;s commodities during the resolution of the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Trade&lt;/i&gt; strategic action.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Making a deal for a player to vote on an agenda in a certain way, when it is not yet that player&amp;rsquo;s opportunity to vote.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Any deal that will resolve after dice are rolled.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;If a player becomes eliminated and the Nekro Virus&amp;rsquo; assimilator &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; or assimilator &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rdquo; token is placed on one of their faction technologies, that technology remains in play.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Ghost of Creuss player becomes eliminated, their wormhole tokens remain on the game board for the remainder of the game.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Naalu player becomes eliminated while another player has the Naalu player&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; token, that token remains with its current player until the end of the status phase, and then it is removed from play.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Titans of Ul player becomes eliminated while their hero or promissory note is attached to a planet, those attachments and attachment tokens remain in play for the remainder of the game.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact Gene&amp;ndash;Sorcerers become eliminated while they have another player&amp;rsquo;s command tokens on their faction sheet, those command tokens are returned to their respective players&amp;rsquo; reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the Mahact Gene&amp;ndash;Sorcerers have an eliminated player&amp;rsquo;s command token on their faction sheet, that command token remains in play, as does the eliminated player&amp;rsquo;s commander, if it is unlocked.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player becomes eliminated, any units they have captured are returned to the reinforcements of their original owners.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>

    &lt;li&gt;While the Arborec flagship may produce units, it does not have the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability. Having it on the game board will not prevent the Arborec player from being eliminated. This applies to all similar effects in the game.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An eliminated player&amp;rsquo;s home system remains a home system for game effects.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This includes effects that specify &amp;ldquo;another player&amp;rsquo;s home system&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an eliminated player had any relic fragments, they are discarded to their respective exploration discard piles. If an eliminated player had any relics, they are purged.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player is eliminated, any of their units that are captured remain with the player that captured them. When the capturing player would return them, the units are instead returned to the game box.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Some cards can be exhausted. A player cannot resolve abilities or spend the resources or influence of an exhausted card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To exhaust a card, a player flips the card facedown.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the &lt;b&gt;Ready Cards&lt;/b&gt; step of the status phase, each player readies all of their exhausted cards by flipping those cards faceup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player exhausts their planet cards to spend either the resources or influence on that card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Abilities, including some found on technology cards, may instruct a player to exhaust a card to resolve those abilities. If a card is already exhausted, it cannot be exhausted again.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Passive abilities on an exhausted card are still in effect while that card is exhausted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_Exploration" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Planets and some space areas can be explored, yielding varying results determined by the cards drawn from the exploration decks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player takes control of a planet that is not already controlled by another player, they explore that planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player explores a planet, they draw and resolve a card from the exploration deck that corresponds to that planet&amp;rsquo;s trait.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;There are three planetary exploration decks, each of which corresponds to a planet trait: cultural, hazardous, and industrial.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Planets that do not have traits, such as Mecatol Rex and planets in home systems, cannot be explored.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a planet has multiple traits, the player exploring the planet chooses which of the corresponding exploration decks to draw from.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a player gains control of multiple planets or resolves multiple explore effects at the same time, they choose the order in which they resolve those explorations, completely resolving each exploration card before resolving the next.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Certain abilities may allow a planet to be explored multiple times.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players can explore space areas that contain frontier tokens if they own the &lt;i&gt;Dark Energy Tap&lt;/i&gt; technology or if another game effect allows them to.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frontier tokens are placed in systems during setup and by specific abilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player explores a frontier token, they draw and resolve a card from the frontier exploration deck.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After a frontier token is explored, it is discarded and returned to the supply.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To resolve an exploration card, a player reads the card, makes any necessary decisions, and resolves its ability. If the card was not a relic fragment or an attachment, it is discarded into its respective discard pile.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If there are no cards in an exploration deck, its discard pile is shuffled to form a new exploration deck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player resolves an exploration card that has an &amp;ldquo;attach&amp;rdquo; header, they attach that card to the planet card of the planet being explored.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player resolves an exploration card that has &amp;ldquo;relic fragment&amp;rdquo; in the title, they place that card faceup in their play area.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Players can resolve the ability of relic fragments that are in their play area. Resolving these abilities allows players to draw cards from the relic deck.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Relic fragments can be exchanged as part of transactions.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enigmatic Device&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ion Storm&lt;/i&gt; are placed into play, not into the frontier discard pile.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player is to gain multiple planets in a system, they choose the order in which they gain them, and explore each planet as they gain it before gaining the next.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may perform transactions after revealing an exploration card and before resolving it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Before resolving an exploration card, it is revealed to all players.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;When producing a fighter unit, a player can use a fighter token from the supply instead of a plastic piece.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players can replace their plastic fighters with tokens at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player ever has a fighter token in a system that does not contain one of their plastic fighters, that player must replace it with a plastic fighter from their reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the player cannot replace the token, the unit is destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fighter tokens come in values of one and three. A player can swap between these tokens as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;

This will usually only be caused by effects that place units in a system during combat. When combat ends, however units will need to be removed to meet capacity and fleet pool requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ships may be moved into, produced in or placed in a system even if doing so would exceed the fleet pool limit. However, some of those ships must immediately be removed to satisfy the limit.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;A ship that will move out of or through a gravity rift at any time during its movement, applies +1 to its move value.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;This can allow a ship to reach the active system from farther away than it normally could.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;For each ship that would move out of or through a gravity rift, one die is rolled immediately before it exits the gravity rift system; on a result of 1&amp;ndash;3, that ship is removed from the board.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Dice are not rolled for units that are being transported by ships that have capacity.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Units that are removed are returned to the player&amp;rsquo;s reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A gravity rift can affect the same ship multiple times during a single movement.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Moving into a gravity rift will not provide the +1, nor will the ships have to roll for removal.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ship removed by a gravity rift is not destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All ship movement must be declared before any roll for gravity rift removal. A player may not move additional ships after seeing the result of this roll.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ship that is removed by a gravity rift will not count toward the fleet limit in the destination system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Retreating from a gravity rift will result in the following:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The retreating player must declare which, if any, fighters and ground forces they are moving, and which ships will be transporting them. If they have the Fighter II technology, then for each fighter, they must choose if that fighter is moving itself or being transported.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Each non&amp;ndash;fighter ship and each Fighter II moving itself will have to roll for removal. Transported units are also removed if they ship transporting them is removed.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The +1 will have no effect, as retreats are restricted to adjacent systems.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If all ships are lost to the rift, the retreating player will not place a command token in the destination system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a ship moves through or out of multiple gravity rifts, and/or the same gravity rift multiple times, each instance will provide a +1 to movement, and requires a separate roll for removal.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a ship with capacity would transport another unit after moving out of or through a gravity rift, but is removed, that unit remains where it is.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A system containing a Vuil&amp;rsquo;raith Dimensional Tear is a gravity rift, and thus an anomaly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A future rule change will place the ship movement restrictions of anomalies upon all units.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_GroundCombat" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;b&gt;Ground Combat&lt;/b&gt; step of an invasion, if the active player has ground forces on a planet that contains another player&amp;rsquo;s ground forces, those players resolve a ground combat on that planet. To resolve a ground combat, players perform the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1 &amp;ndash; Roll Dice&lt;/b&gt;: Each player rolls one die for each ground force they have on the planet; this is a combat roll. If a unit&amp;rsquo;s combat roll produces a result that is equal to or greater than that unit&amp;rsquo;s combat value, that roll produces a hit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a unit&amp;rsquo;s combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls one die for each burst icon instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2 &amp;ndash; Assign Hits&lt;/b&gt;: Each player in the combat must choose one of their own ground forces on the planet to be destroyed for each hit result their opponent produced.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When a unit is destroyed, the player who controls that unit removes it from the board and places it in their reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After assigning hits, if both players still have ground forces on the planet, players resolve a new combat round starting with the &lt;b&gt;Roll Dice&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ground combat ends when only one player (or neither player) has ground forces on the planet.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;After a combat ends, the player with one or more ground forces remaining on the planet is the winner of the combat; the other player is the loser of the combat.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If neither player has a ground force remaining, there is no winner; the combat ends in a draw.&lt;/li&gt;

The active player chooses the order combats are fought in.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may score up to one secret objective per ground combat. If there is combat on multiple planets, a player may score a secret objective in each.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;When using the five&amp;ndash; and seven&amp;ndash;player hyperlane setups, the system tile in the center of the ring of hyperlanes is not on the edge of the game board.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When using the seven&amp;ndash; and eight&amp;ndash;player alternate setups, only the system tiles designated as &amp;ldquo;Ring 3&amp;rdquo; and home systems are on the edge of the game board, along with the Creuss home system and the wormhole nexus.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Adjacent for all purposes&amp;rdquo; includes:&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Neighbors.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Any other game effect that specifies adjacent systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Hyperlanes on the same tile that converge at a point on the tile edge are not connected. For example, with the &amp;ldquo;Five&amp;ndash;Player Galaxy Setup (With Hyperlanes)&amp;rdquo; in the &lt;i&gt;Prophecy of Kings&lt;/i&gt; Map Appendix, the hyperlanes on tile 87A do not connect tiles 39 and 63, and the hyperlanes on tile 88A do not connect tiles 41 and 80.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;To resolve the primary ability on the &lt;i&gt;Imperial&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, the active player can score one public objective of their choice if they meet that objective&amp;rsquo;s requirements as described on its card. Then, if the active player controls Mecatol Rex, they gain one victory point; if they do not control Mecatol Rex, they can draw one secret objective card.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Invasion is a step of the tactical action during which the active player can land ground forces on planets to gain control of those planets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve an invasion, players perform the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1 &amp;ndash; Bombardment&lt;/b&gt;: The active player may use the &lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt; ability of any of their units in the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2 &amp;ndash; Commit Ground Forces&lt;/b&gt;: If the active player has ground forces in the space area of the active system, that player may commit any number of those ground forces to land on any of the planets in that system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;To commit a ground force to a planet, the active player places that ground force unit on that planet.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The planet may contain another player&amp;rsquo;s ground forces.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the active player does not wish to commit ground forces, that player proceeds to the &lt;b&gt;Production&lt;/b&gt; step of the tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3 &amp;ndash; Space Cannon Defense&lt;/b&gt;: If the active player commits any ground forces to a planet that contains units that have the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability, those &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; abilities can be used against the committed ground forces.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the active player committed ground forces to more than one planet that contained units with a &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability, the active player chooses the order in which those &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; abilities are resolved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 4 &amp;ndash; Ground Combat&lt;/b&gt;: If the active player has ground forces on a planet in the active system that contains another player&amp;rsquo;s ground forces, those players resolve a ground combat on that planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If players must resolve a combat on more than one planet, the active player chooses the order in which those combats are resolved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 5 &amp;ndash; Establish Control&lt;/b&gt;: The active player gains control of each planet they committed ground forces to if that planet still contains at least one of their ground forces.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When a player gains control of a planet, any structures on the planet that belong to other players are immediately destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When a player gains control of a planet, they gain the planet card that matches that planet and exhaust that card.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player cannot gain control of a planet they already control.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If there was a combat, and all units belonging to both players were destroyed, the player who was the defender retains control of the planet and places one of their control tokens on the planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;If a player gains control of an uncontrolled planet during the &lt;b&gt;Establish Control&lt;/b&gt; step, they explore it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player gains control of a legendary planet, they gain the legendary planet ability card in addition to the planet card. The card will not be exhausted if it was readied.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Nomad&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;The Company&lt;/sc&gt; faction ability grants them two additional agents, for a total of five leaders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player&amp;rsquo;s leaders are placed on their leader sheet during setup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;

    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Commanders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Each faction&amp;rsquo;s commander has a unique &amp;ldquo;Unlock&amp;rdquo; condition.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;A commander&amp;rsquo;s unlock conditions cannot be met while an ability or game effect is being resolved. That is, pending abilities or partially resolved game effects must be completed before checking if conditions are met.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A commander cannot flip to its locked side after it is unlocked, even if its owner no longer meets the unlock conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A commander cannot be exhausted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note allows a player to share their commander&amp;rsquo;s ability with another player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A commander&amp;rsquo;s owner can still use their commander&amp;rsquo;s ability, even if another player has their &lt;i&gt;Alliance&lt;/i&gt; promissory note.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heroes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A hero needs to be unlocked to use their abilities. A player unlocks their hero if they fulfill the conditions listed after the &amp;ldquo;Unlock&amp;rdquo; header.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Unlock&amp;rdquo; condition for each hero is to have three scored objectives; these can be any combination of secret objectives and public objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Victory points do not count toward unlocking heroes.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;After a player fulfills the unlock condition of their hero, they flip it to its unlocked side.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A hero cannot flip to its locked side after it is unlocked.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A hero cannot be exhausted.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Move is an attribute of some units that is presented on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A unit&amp;rsquo;s move value indicates the distance from its current system that it can move during the &lt;b&gt;Movement&lt;/b&gt; step of a tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>

  <data name="RuleCategory_Movement" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;A player can move their ships by resolving a tactical action during the action phase. Additionally, some abilities can move a unit outside of the tactical action.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tactical Action Movement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ship&amp;rsquo;s move value is presented along with its other attributes on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards. This value indicates the distance from its current system that a ship can move.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To resolve movement, players perform the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1 &amp;ndash; Move Ships&lt;/b&gt;: A player can move any number of their eligible ships into the active system, obeying the following rules:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The ship must end its movement in the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The ship cannot move through a system that contains ships that are controlled by another player.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The ship &lt;b&gt;cannot&lt;/b&gt; move if it started its movement in another system that contains one of its faction&amp;rsquo;s command tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The ship &lt;b&gt;can&lt;/b&gt; move through systems that contain its own faction&amp;rsquo;s command tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The ship &lt;b&gt;can&lt;/b&gt; move out of the &lt;b&gt;active&lt;/b&gt; system and back into it if its move value is high enough.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The ship must move along a path of adjacent systems, and the number of systems the ship enters cannot exceed its move value.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a ship with a capacity value moves or is moved, it may transport ground forces and fighters.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The active player declares which of their ships are moving before any ships move. Those ships arrive in the active system simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2 &amp;ndash; Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt;: After the &lt;b&gt;Move Ships&lt;/b&gt; step, players can use the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; abilities of their units in the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability Movement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an ability moves a unit outside of the &lt;b&gt;Movement&lt;/b&gt; step of a tactical action, players follow the rules specified by that ability; neither a unit&amp;rsquo;s move value nor the rules specified above apply.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_Movement_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When an effect moves a unit to an adjacent system, modifying that unit&amp;rsquo;s move value will have no effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;An ability may move a player&amp;rsquo;s ship out of a system containing one of the player&amp;rsquo;s faction&amp;rsquo;s commend tokens. However, the transport rules prevent a player&amp;rsquo;s units from being transported from systems containing one of that player&amp;rsquo;s command tokens, other than the active system. An ability that moves a player&amp;rsquo;s ship must also explicitly allow it to transport units from non&amp;ndash;active systems containing that player&amp;rsquo;s faction&amp;rsquo;s command token for it to be able to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During a retreat, units may be transported from the active system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ship that can both move and be transported (i.e. Fighter II) cannot do both by &amp;ldquo;meeting&amp;rdquo; a ship with capacity partway though a tactical action movement, as all movement is simultaneous.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Ships only move &amp;ldquo;into&amp;rdquo; the destination system. A ship may move &amp;ldquo;through&amp;rdquo; other systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fighters alone will block other player&amp;rsquo;s ships from moving through that system, whether they are accompanied by a Space Dock or they are Fighters II.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A ship cannot move through a nebula. That is, a ship cannot move into and out of a nebula during the same movement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ship that begins the &lt;b&gt;Movement&lt;/b&gt; step of a tactical action in a nebula treats its move value as &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo; for the duration of that step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other abilities and effects can increase this number.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_ObjectiveCards" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Players can score objectives to gain victory points.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There are two types of objective cards: public objectives and secret objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each public objective has a &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;II&amp;rdquo; on the back of its card; all other objectives are secret objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each objective card indicates a number of victory points that a player gains by scoring that objective.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each objective card indicates the phase during which a player can score that objective &amp;ndash; the status, action, or agenda phases.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each objective card describes the requirement a player must fulfill to score that objective.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player fulfills the requirement described on an objective card, they can score that objective following the timing indicated on the card, either during the action phase or the status phase.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When a player scores an objective during the status phase, they must fulfill the requirement on the card during the &lt;b&gt;Score Objectives&lt;/b&gt; step of the status phase to score that objective.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When a player scores an objective during the action phase, they can do so at any time during that phase.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When a player scores an objective during the agenda phase, they can do so at any time during that phase.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player can score a maximum of one public objective and one secret objective during each status phase.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player can score any number of objectives during the agenda phase or during a turn of the action phase; however, they can only score one objective during or after each combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A player can score an objective during both the space combat and the ground combat during the same tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player can score each objective only once during the game.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an objective requires a player to destroy one or more units, those units can be destroyed by producing hits against them, playing action cards, using technology, or any number of other abilities that use the &amp;ldquo;destroy&amp;rdquo; terminology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Forcing a player to remove a unit from the board by reducing the number of command tokens in their fleet pool is not treated as destroying a unit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players can score some objectives by spending resources, influence, or tokens, as described by the objective card. To score such an objective, a player must pay the specified cost at the time indicated on the card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public Objectives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A public objective is an objective that is revealed to all players.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When scoring a public objective, the player places one of their control tokens on that objective&amp;rsquo;s card. Then, that player advances their control token on the victory point track a number of spaces equal to the number of victory points gained.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each game contains five stage I and five stage II public objective cards that the speaker places facedown near the victory point track during setup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The speaker reveals two of the stage I objective cards during setup. All other objective cards remain facedown.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During each status phase, the speaker reveals a facedown public objective card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The speaker does not reveal stage II objective cards until all stage I objective cards are revealed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the speaker must reveal a facedown public objective card but all public objective cards are already revealed, the game ends immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The player with the most victory points is the winner. If one or more players are tied for having the most victory points, the tied player who is first in initiative order is the winner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot score public objectives if that player does not control each planet in their home system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Secret Objectives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A secret objective is an objective that is controlled by one player and is hidden from all other players until it is scored.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When scoring a secret objective, a player reveals the objective by placing it faceup in their play area. Then, they place one of their control tokens on that objective&amp;rsquo;s card and advances their control token on the victory point track a number of spaces equal to the number of victory points gained.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player can only score their own secret objectives; a player cannot score secret objectives revealed by other players.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each player begins the game with one secret objective.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each player can have up to &lt;b&gt;three total&lt;/b&gt; scored and unscored secret objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a player draws a secret objective and has more than three, that player must choose one of their unscored secret objectives and return it to the deck. Then, that player shuffles the secret objective deck.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player can gain secret objectives by resolving either the primary or secondary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Imperial&lt;/i&gt; strategy card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_ObjectiveCards_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A status phase objective must have its condition met during the status phase; any activity during the action phase is irrelevant.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may choose to reveal any or all of the secret objective cards in their hand, if they so choose.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If multiple ground combats happen on separate planets as part of a single invasion during one action, one secret objective may be scored during each.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Bombardment&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/b&gt; steps happen outside of combat; any number of secret objectives may be scored during those steps, and do not prevent another secret objective being scored during combat that turn.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/b&gt; step, however, is a step during combat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may score an action phase secret objective when they are not the active player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player with three scored secret objectives may draw a fourth. However, they must immediately shuffle it into the secret objective deck.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Planets provide players with resources and influence. Planets are on system tiles and each has a name, a resource value, and an influence value. Some planets also have traits.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;A planet&amp;rsquo;s trait has no inherent effects, but some game effects refer to a planet&amp;rsquo;s trait. There are three traits: cultural, hazardous, and industrial.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some planets have a technology specialty, which allows those planets to be exhausted to satisfy a prerequisite when researching technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some planets are legendary planets, as indicated by the legendary planet icon. When a player gains control of a legendary planet, they also gain control of its legendary planet ability card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Planet Card&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

After those players have discarded down to their seven card hand limit, if necessary, the discard pile will be shuffled to form a new deck. The remaining players (including the player who received the last action card from the previous deck, if applicable) will then be dealt their action cards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When resolving the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Politics&lt;/i&gt; card, the active player cannot show the agenda cards they drew to any other player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>

  <data name="RuleCategory_ProducingUnits" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The primary way that a player produces new units is by resolving the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; abilities of existing units during a tactical action. However, other game effects also allow players to produce units.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each unit that a player can produce has a cost value presented on its faction sheet or technology card. To produce a unit, a player must spend a number of resources equal to or greater than the cost value of the unit they are producing.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Spent resources must come from planets or trade goods that are controlled by the player who is producing the units.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Any resources spent in excess of a unit&amp;rsquo;s cost are lost.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a player is producing multiple units at a time, that player can add the cost of each unit they are producing to create a total cost before they spend any resources.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the cost is accompanied by two icons &amp;ndash; typically for fighters and infantry &amp;ndash; a player produces two of that unit for that cost.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Each of the two units counts toward the total number of units a player can produce.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player can choose to produce only one unit; however, they must still pay the entire cost.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player produces a unit through the use of their units&amp;rsquo; &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; abilities during a tactical action, that player follows the rules of the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability to determine where in the active system the units can be placed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player produces a unit through an ability outside of the tactical action, that ability will state how many units that player can produce and where that player can place those units.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player cannot produce a unit on a planet they do not control.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If an ability allows a player to produce a unit in a system, they may produce that unit in the space area or on a planet they control in that system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player is limited by the number of units in their reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a player cannot produce a unit because it is not in their reinforcements, that player can remove a unit from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that unit in their reinforcements. Then, that player can produce that unit. A player can remove any number of their units in this way; however, any units that are removed must be produced immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When producing a fighter or infantry unit, a player can use a fighter or infantry token, as appropriate, from the supply instead of a plastic piece.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot produce ships in a system that contains other players&amp;rsquo; ships.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ground forces can still be produced.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_ProducingUnits_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Whenever a unit is produced, its cost must be paid, unless the effect that is producing the unit explicitly says otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot produce one fighter and one infantry for one resource.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an effect allows a player produce a ship of a specific type, then factional variations do not prevent that player from producing that type of ship.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player removes a unit in order to place it, because they have none of that unit type in their reinforcements, that unit is placed undamaged.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_Production" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;b&gt;Production&lt;/b&gt; step of a tactical action, the active player can resolve the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability of each of their units that are in the active system to produce units&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A unit&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability, which is presented on a faction sheet or unit upgrade technology card, is always followed by a value. This value is the maximum number of units that this unit can produce.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the active player has multiple units in the active system that have the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability, that player can produce a number of units up to the combined total of their units&amp;rsquo; production values in that system.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When producing fighters or infantry, each individual unit counts toward the producing unit&amp;rsquo;s production limit.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player can choose to produce one fighter or infantry instead of two, but must still pay the entire cost.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; value from Arborec space docks cannot be used to produce infantry, even if the Arborec player controls other units that have &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; in the same system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player produces ships by using &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; that player must place them in the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player produces ground forces, that player must place those unit on planets that contain a unit that used its &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player uses the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability of a unit in a space area of a system to produce ground forces, those ground forces may either be placed on a planet the player controls in that system or in the space area of that system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_Production_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A unit&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; value is the maximum number of units that may be produced by that unit, regardless of cost. For example, a space dock with &amp;ldquo;&lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; 6&amp;rdquo; could produce six dreadnoughts or six fighters.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Placement of produced units is not limited by a unit&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; value, only by the location of the producing units.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, say a player is performing a tactical action on tile 75. They have one Space Dock I each on Abaddon and Ashtroth, but not on Loki. They combine their production to place seven infantry. They could place all seven on Abaddon, all seven on Ashtroth, or split them. They cannot place any on Loki.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an effect allows a player produce a ship of a specific type, then factional variations do not prevent that player from producing that type of ship.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promissory notes are &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; mandatory unless otherwise specified.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot play their color&amp;rsquo;s or faction&amp;rsquo;s promissory notes. Since the cards are only valuable to other players, promissory notes can be traded as powerful negotiation tools.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Promissory notes that are returned to a player are returned after their abilities have been completely resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a promissory note is returned to a player, that player may give it to other players again as part of a future transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;An unrevealed promissory note is not subject to effects in its ability text that return the card if certain conditions are met.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When resolving a transaction, a player can trade a maximum of one promissory note from their hand to another player, even if that card originally belonged to another player.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promissory notes in the play area cannot be traded.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During a tactical action, after the &lt;b&gt;Move Ships&lt;/b&gt; substep of the &lt;b&gt;Movement&lt;/b&gt; step, beginning with the active player and proceeding clockwise, each player may use the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability of each of their units in the active system by performing the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1 &amp;ndash; Roll  Dice&lt;/b&gt;: The player rolls dice for each of their units in the active system that has the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability; this is a space cannon roll. One hit is produced for each result that is equal to or greater than the unit&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; value.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;&lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; is displayed as &amp;ldquo;&lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; X (&amp;times;Y).&amp;rdquo; The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; abilities are accompanied by a (Y) value; a space cannon roll for such a unit consists of one die.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a player has a PDS unit upgrade technology, they can use the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability of their PDS units that are in systems that are adjacent to the active system. The hits are still assigned to units in the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect space cannon rolls.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This ability can be used even if no ships were moved during the &lt;b&gt;Move Ships&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2 &amp;ndash; Assign  Hits&lt;/b&gt;: The player whose units have been targeted by &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; must choose and destroy one of their ships in the active system for each hit result produced against their units.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;Players other than the active player must target the active player&amp;rsquo;s units.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Space Cannon Defense&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the invasion step of a tactical action, after ground forces have been committed to land on planets, players other than the active player can resolve the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability of their units on those planets by performing the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1 &amp;ndash; Roll Dice&lt;/b&gt;: Each player may use the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability of each of their units on the invaded planet by rolling a specific number of dice for each of those units; this is called a space cannon roll. A hit is produced for each die roll that is equal to or greater than the unit&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; value.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a unit has a &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability, it is present on its faction sheet and technology cards.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; is displayed as &amp;ldquo;&lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; X (&amp;times;Y).&amp;rdquo; The X is the minimum value needed for a die to produce a hit, and Y is the number of dice rolled. Not all &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; abilities are accompanied by a (Y) value; a space cannon roll for such a unit consists of one die.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Game effects that reroll, modify, or otherwise affect combat rolls do not affect space cannon rolls.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Game effects that allow the use of &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; abilities against ships in adjacent systems have no effect during Space Cannon Defense.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2 &amp;ndash; Assign Hits&lt;/b&gt;: The active player must choose and destroy one of their ground forces on the planet for each hit the space cannon roll produced.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hits can only be assigned to units that are on the same planet as the units using the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;sc&gt;Deep Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt;&amp;rdquo; is not a term with meaning within the rules. It is, however, used within the notes on this website as a shorthand for &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; abilities that can be used against ships in an adjacent system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; step happens before combat. Any secret objectives that require winning a combat or similar cannot be scored if all of one player&amp;rsquo;s ships in a system are destroyed during this step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player chooses to use the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability of their units, they must do so for all of their eligible units with the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability. This includes units in adjacent systems, if applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A player that chooses to use the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability of their units may choose whether or not they use the ability of the &lt;i&gt;Plasma Scoring&lt;/i&gt; technology, if they own it, and any similar abilities, independent of one another.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may use the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability of a ship in the active system to cancel a hit produced during the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may use the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability of a mech committed to a planet to cancel a produced during the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Defense&lt;/b&gt; step by a unit on that planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If multiple players are resolving the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability of their units against the active player, the active player must resolve capacity limits after assigning one player&amp;rsquo;s hits and before the next player make their space cannon roll.&lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot assign hits produced by a space cannon roll to their own units.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; side of the d10 represents a result of 10.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;After resolving the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; step of a tactical action, if two players have ships in the active system, those players must resolve a space combat.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the active player is the only player with ships in the system, they skip the &lt;b&gt;Space Combat&lt;/b&gt; step of the tactical action and proceeds to the &lt;b&gt;Invasion&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an ability occurs &amp;ldquo;before combat&amp;rdquo;, it occurs immediately before the &lt;b&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;During the first round of a combat, &amp;ldquo;start of combat&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;start of combat round&amp;rdquo; effects occur during the same timing window.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;During the last round of a combat, &amp;ldquo;end of combat&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;end of combat round&amp;rdquo; effects occur during the same timing window.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To resolve a space combat, players perform the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1 &amp;ndash; Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/b&gt;: If this is the first round of a space combat, the players may simultaneously use the &lt;sc&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/sc&gt; ability of any of their units in the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If one or both players no longer have ships in the active system after resolving this step, the space combat ends immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Players cannot resolve &lt;sc&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage&lt;/sc&gt; abilities during any rounds of space combat other than the first round.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This step still occurs if no fighters are present.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2 &amp;ndash; Announce Retreats&lt;/b&gt;: Each player may announce a retreat, beginning with the defender.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A retreat will not occur immediately; the units retreat during the &lt;b&gt;Retreat&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the defender announces a retreat, the attacker cannot announce a retreat during that combat round.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player cannot announce a retreat if there is not at least one eligible system to retreat to.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3 &amp;ndash; Roll Dice&lt;/b&gt;: Each player rolls one die for each ship they have in the active system; this is called a combat roll. If a unit&amp;rsquo;s combat roll produces a result that is equal to or greater than that unit&amp;rsquo;s combat value, that result produces a hit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a unit&amp;rsquo;s combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls one die for each burst icon instead.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a player has ships that have different combat values in the active system, that player rolls these dice separately.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;First, that player should roll all dice for units with a combat value of &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo;. Then, that player should roll all dice for units with combat value of &amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo;, and then &amp;ldquo;3&amp;rdquo;, continuing in numerical order until that player has rolled dice for each of their ships.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The player counts each hit their combat rolls produce. The total number of hits produced will destroy units during the &lt;b&gt;Assign Hits&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a player has an ability that rerolls a die or affects a die after it is rolled, that player must resolve such an ability immediately after rolling all of their dice.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The attacker makes all of their combat rolls during this step before the defender. This procedure is important for abilities that allow a player to reroll an opponent&amp;rsquo;s die.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 4 &amp;ndash; Assign Hits&lt;/b&gt;: Each player in the combat must choose and destroy one of their own ships in the active system for each hit their opponent produced.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Before assigning hits, players may use their units&amp;rsquo; &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; abilities to cancel hits.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;When a unit is destroyed, the player who controls that unit removes it from the board and places it in their reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 5 &amp;ndash; Retreat&lt;/b&gt;: If a player announced a retreat during &lt;b&gt;step 2&lt;/b&gt;, and there is still an eligible system for their units to retreat to, they must retreat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If a player announced a retreat during the &lt;b&gt;Announce Retreats&lt;/b&gt; step, but their opponent has no ships remaining in the system, the combat immediately ends and the retreat does not occur.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;To retreat, a player takes all of their ships with a move value in the combat and moves them to a single system that is adjacent to the active system. That player&amp;rsquo;s fighters and ground forces in the space area of the active system that are unable to move or be transported are removed.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The system that a player&amp;rsquo;s units retreat to must contain one or more of that player&amp;rsquo;s units, a planet they control, or both. Additionally, the system cannot contain ships controlled by another player.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If any of a player&amp;rsquo;s units successfully retreat and are moved into an adjacent system, that player must place a command token from their reinforcements in the system to which their units retreated. If that system already contains one of their command tokens, that player does not place an additional token there. If the player has no command tokens in their reinforcements, that player must use one from their command sheet instead.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After the &lt;b&gt;Retreat&lt;/b&gt; step, if both players still have ships in the active system, those players resolve another round of space combat beginning with the &lt;b&gt;Announce Retreats&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Space combat ends when only one player &amp;ndash; or neither player &amp;ndash; has a ship in the space area of the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During the last round of a combat, &amp;ldquo;end of combat&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;end of combat round&amp;rdquo; effects occur during the same timing window.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After a combat ends, the player with one or more ships remaining in the system is the winner of the combat; the other player is the loser of the combat. If neither player has a ship remaining, the combat ends in a draw and there is no winner.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the winner of the combat has fighters or ground forces in the space area of the active system and those units exceed the capacity of that player&amp;rsquo;s ships in that system, that player must choose and remove any excess units.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>

  <data name="RuleCategory_SpaceCombat_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player&amp;rsquo;s fighters and ground forces do not count against capacity during combat. At the end of combat, any excess units are removed and returned to that player&amp;rsquo;s reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may retreat into an asteroid field only if that player owns the &lt;i&gt;Antimass Deflectors&lt;/i&gt; technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may retreat into a supernova only if that player owns the &lt;i&gt;Magmus Reactor&lt;/i&gt; Muaat factional technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot retreat into a nebula.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The Empyrean player may retreat into a nebula.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Shared Research&lt;/i&gt; law will not allow a player to retreat into a nebula.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player may attempt to retreat from a combat in a gravity rift, but will still be affected by it. See the Gravity Rift section for more details.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player only has fighters I in the combat when they retreat, those will be removed from the board, and they will not place a command token in an adjacent system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Nav Suite&lt;/i&gt; action card will not allow a player ignore an anomaly while retreating.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Dark Energy Tap&lt;/i&gt; technology allows a player to retreat into a system that does not contain their ships or a planet they control.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Modifying the move value of a ship will have no effect when retreating. Retreats are limited to adjacent systems.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;While retreating, a player cannot transport more fighters and/or ground forces than they have capacity in the retreating ships.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Capacity is checked after the winner of a space combat is determined. As such, it is possible to win a space combat with only fighters remaining, before removing those fighters due to lack of capacity.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_SpaceDock" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;A space dock is a structure that allows players to produce units.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each space dock has a &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability that indicates the number of units it can produce.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The primary way in which players acquire space docks is by resolving either the primary or secondary abilities of the &lt;i&gt;Construction&lt;/i&gt; strategy card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Space docks are placed on planets. Each planet can have a maximum of &lt;b&gt;one&lt;/b&gt; space dock.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player&amp;rsquo;s space dock is ever on a planet that does not contain any of their ground forces and contains a unit that belongs to another player, that space dock is destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Clan of Saar&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Floating Factory&lt;/i&gt; faction&amp;ndash;specific space dock is destroyed when it is blockaded; that is to say, when it is in a system with another player&amp;rsquo;s ships and none of the Clan of Saar&amp;rsquo;s ships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Fighters transported during movement remain assigned to the transporting ship until movement is complete. They cannot be counted towards a space dock&amp;rsquo;s allocation until after movement is complete.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a player moves one of their units with capacity into a system, transporting fighters, they cannot pick up ground forces from a planet in that system with that ship by transferring those fighters to a space dock in that system to free up capacity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_Speaker" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The speaker is the player who has the speaker token.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the strategy phase, the speaker is the first player to choose a strategy card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the agenda phase, the speaker reveals the top agenda card from the agenda deck before each vote. The speaker is always the last player to vote and decides which outcome to resolve if the outcomes are tied.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During setup, the speaker prepares the objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the status phase, the speaker reveals a public objective.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A random player gains the speaker token during setup before the game begins.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the action phase, if a player resolves the primary ability on the &lt;i&gt;Politics&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, that player chooses any player other than the current speaker to gain the speaker token.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the speaker is eliminated from the game, the speaker token is passed to the player to the speaker&amp;rsquo;s left.&lt;/li&gt;

  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_StatusPhase" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;During the status phase, players score objectives and prepare for the next game round. To resolve the status phase, players perform the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1 &amp;ndash; Score Objectives&lt;/b&gt;: Following initiative order, each player may score up to one public objective and one secret objective that can be fulfilled during the status phase. To score an objective, a player must fulfill the requirements on the card; if that player does, they gain a number of victory points indicated on the card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2 &amp;ndash; Reveal Public Objective&lt;/b&gt;: The speaker reveals an unrevealed public objective card by flipping that card faceup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The speaker cannot reveal &amp;ldquo;Stage II&amp;rdquo; objectives until all &amp;ldquo;Stage I&amp;rdquo; objectives are revealed.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The game ends if there are no unrevealed public objectives at the start of this step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3 &amp;ndash; Draw Action Cards&lt;/b&gt;: Following initiative order, each player draws one action card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 4 &amp;ndash; Remove Command Tokens&lt;/b&gt;: Each player removes all of their command tokens from the game board. Each player returns each removed token to their reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 5 &amp;ndash; Gain and Redistribute Command Tokens&lt;/b&gt;: Each player gains two command tokens. A player takes each gained token from their reinforcements. Then, each player can redistribute each command token on their command sheet, including the two they just gained, among their strategy, tactic, and fleet pools.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Players should remember to check the number of their ships in each system after reducing the size of their fleet pools.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;This step can usually be resolved simultaneously, but if there is a timing conflict, it is resolved in initiative order.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 6 &amp;ndash; Ready Cards&lt;/b&gt;: Each player readies all of their exhausted cards, including strategy cards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 7 &amp;ndash; Repair Units&lt;/b&gt;: Each player repairs all of their damaged units by turning those units upright.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 8 &amp;ndash; Return Strategy Cards&lt;/b&gt;: Each player returns their strategy card to the common play area. Then, if a player has removed the custodians token from Mecatol Rex, the game round continues to the agenda phase. Otherwise, a new game round begins with the strategy phase.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot score public objectives if that player does not control each planet in their home system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If there are few cards remaining in the action card deck, they will be dealt out first to the players lowest in initiative order. After those players have discarded down to their seven card hand limit, if necessary, the discard pile will be shuffled to form a new deck. The remaining players (including the player who received the last action card from the previous deck, if applicable) will then be dealt their action cards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;All damaged units will be repaired, even if a game effect has caused those units to no longer have the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;During the action phase, the active player may perform a strategic action to resolve the primary ability on their strategy card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During three&amp;ndash; and four&amp;ndash;player games, a player must resolve the strategic action on each of their chosen strategy cards before they can pass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Strategy cards determine initiative order and provide each player with a powerful ability that they can use one time during the action phase.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;During the strategy phase, each player chooses a strategy card from the common play area and places it in their play area faceup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each strategy card has a readied and an exhausted side.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The readied side contains the strategy card&amp;rsquo;s name, initiative number, and abilities.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;During the strategy phase, each player chooses a strategy card to use during the round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve the strategy phase, players perform the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1&lt;/b&gt;: Starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise, each player chooses one strategy card from the common play area and places it faceup in their play area.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;If there are one or more trade good tokens on a strategy card when a player chooses it, that player gains those trade goods.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;When playing with three or four players, each player will choose a second strategy card. After the last player has received their first strategy card, each player chooses a second strategy card, starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2&lt;/b&gt;: The speaker places one trade good token from the supply on each strategy card that was not chosen.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During a four&amp;ndash; or eight&amp;ndash;player game, all strategy cards will be chosen, and therefore no trade good tokens will be placed on strategy cards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;A player can have a maximum of &lt;b&gt;one&lt;/b&gt; space dock on each planet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player can have a maximum of &lt;b&gt;two&lt;/b&gt; PDS units on each planet.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Some units have the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability. Immediately before a player assigns hits to their units, that player can use the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability of any of their units in the active system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;For each &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability that a player uses, one hit produced by another player&amp;rsquo;s units is canceled. Then, each unit using this ability is placed on its side to indicate that it is damaged.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A damaged unit does not have reduced capabilities and is functionally the same as an undamaged unit, except that it cannot use the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A damaged unit cannot use the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability until it is repaired during the status phase or by another game effect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A unit can use its &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability any time a hit is produced against it. This includes hits produced during combat and from unit abilities such as the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A unit can only use the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability if it is eligible to be hit. For example, a player cannot use a dreadnought&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability to cancel a hit from &lt;sc&gt;Anti&amp;ndash;Fighter Barrage.&lt;/sc&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability cannot be used to cancel an effect that directly destroys a unit.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Barony of Letnev&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Non&amp;ndash;Euclidean Shielding&lt;/i&gt; faction technology allows the Letnev player&amp;rsquo;s units with the &lt;sc&gt;Sustain Damage&lt;/sc&gt; ability to cancel up to two hits instead of one.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_TacticalAction" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The tactical action is the primary method by which players produce units, move ships, and extend their dominion within the galaxy. To perform a tactical action, the active player performs the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1 &amp;ndash; Activation&lt;/b&gt;: The active player must activate a system that does not contain one of their command tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;To activate a system, the active player places a command token from their tactic pool in that system. That system is the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Other players&amp;rsquo; command tokens do not prevent a player from activating a system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2 &amp;ndash; Movement&lt;/b&gt;: The active player may move any number of ships that have a sufficient move value from any number of systems that do not contain one of their command tokens into the active system, following the rules for movement.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Ships that have capacity values can transport ground forces and fighters when moving.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The player may choose to not move any ships.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;After the &lt;b&gt;Move Ships&lt;/b&gt; step, all players can use the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; abilities of their units in the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3 &amp;ndash; Space Combat&lt;/b&gt;: If two players have ships in the active system, those players must resolve a space combat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the active player is the only player with ships in the system, they skip this step.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 4 &amp;ndash; Invasion&lt;/b&gt;: The active player may use their &lt;sc&gt;Bombardment&lt;/sc&gt; abilities, commit units to land on planets, and resolve ground combat against other players&amp;rsquo; units.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 5 &amp;ndash; Production&lt;/b&gt;: The active player may resolve each of their unit&amp;rsquo;s &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; abilities in the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The active player may do this even if they did not move units or land ground forces during this tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_TacticalAction_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each of these five steps happen during every tactical action, unless explicitly skipped; the active player does not have to choose between fighting a combat or producing units, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any abilities that occur at the end of an action happen before any abilities that occur at the end of a player&amp;rsquo;s turn.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the action phase, if the active player has the &lt;i&gt;Technology&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card&amp;rsquo;s primary ability.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To resolve the primary ability on the &lt;i&gt;Technology&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, the active player can research one technology of their choice. Then, they may research one additional technology of their choice by spending six resources.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After the active player resolves the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Technology&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may research one technology of their choice by spending one command token from their strategy pool and four resources.&lt;/li&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_TechnologySystem" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Technology cards allow players to upgrade units and acquire powerful abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each player places any technology they have gained faceup near their faction sheet. For the duration of the game, they &lt;b&gt;own&lt;/b&gt; any technology cards they gain and can use the abilities on those cards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player does not own any technology card that is in their technology deck.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player can gain a technology card from their technology deck by researching technology.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both the primary and secondary abilities of the &lt;i&gt;Technology&lt;/i&gt; strategy card allow a player to research a technology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any technology card that a player has not gained remains in their technology deck. A player can look through their technology deck at any time.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an ability instructs a player to &lt;b&gt;gain&lt;/b&gt; a technology, they do not research it; they take it from their technology deck and place it in their play area, ignoring prerequisites.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some technologies are unit upgrades. Unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player&amp;rsquo;s faction sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Players place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each technology that is not a unit upgrade has a colored symbol displayed in the lower&amp;ndash;right corner of the card and on its card back that indicates that technology&amp;rsquo;s color.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A technology&amp;rsquo;s color has no inherent game effect; however, each technology a player owns can satisfy a prerequisite of a matching color when researching other technology.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Unit upgrades do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;There are four colors of technologies. &lt;code&gt;See your rulebook for images.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Most technology cards have a column of colored symbols displayed in the lower&amp;ndash;left corner of the card. Each symbol in this column is a prerequisite.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A technology card&amp;rsquo;s prerequisites indicate the number and color of technologies a player must own to research that technology card.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researching Technology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A player can research technology by resolving either the primary or secondary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Technology&lt;/i&gt; strategy card during the action phase. Other game effects may also instruct a player to research technology.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;To research technology, a player gains that technology card from their technology deck and places it in their play area near their faction sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Players place any unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player cannot research a faction technology that does not match their faction.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When researching technology, a player must satisfy each of a technology&amp;rsquo;s prerequisites to research it. To satisfy a technology&amp;rsquo;s prerequisites, that player must own one technology of the matching color for each prerequisite symbol on the technology card they wish to research.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Prerequisites symbols are displayed as symbols on the lower&amp;ndash;left corner of the card.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Unit upgrade technologies do not have a color and do not satisfy prerequisites.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Players may use certain abilities or technology specialties to ignore some prerequisites.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Technology Specialties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A technology specialty is a technology symbol found on some planets.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When researching technology, a player can exhaust a planet they control that has a technology specialty to ignore one prerequisite symbol of the matching type on the technology card they are researching.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the planet card is already exhausted, it cannot be used to ignore a prerequisite.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;&lt;li&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Nekro Virus faction can use its faction abilities in combination with its two &lt;i&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/i&gt; faction technologies to gain faction technologies that have been researched by other players, including unit upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Basic units printed on faction sheets are not technologies and are not eligible targets for &lt;i&gt;Valefar Assimilator&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player becomes eliminated while one of their technologies has a Valefar Assimilator token on it, the Nekro Virus player places that technology in their play area; it is not removed from the game.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from the Saar &lt;i&gt;Floating Factory&lt;/i&gt; unit upgrade, each of the Nekro Virus&amp;rsquo; space docks must be placed on an eligible planet they control in that space dock&amp;rsquo;s system, or the space dock is returned to their reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a Valefar Assimilator token is removed from a war sun unit upgrade and the Nekro Virus player does not have the standard war sun unit upgrade, each of the Nekro Virus player&amp;rsquo;s war suns are returned to their reinforcements.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The Nekro Virus player may upgrade their units with units of the same type (e.g., &amp;ldquo;dreadnought&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;infantry&amp;rdquo;) even if those unit&amp;rsquo;s names do not match. If the Nekro Virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same unit type as a unit upgrade technology they already have, the previous upgrade is removed, and they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token that was used to copy the previous upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a Valefar Assimilator token is on a technology, that technology&amp;rsquo;s color and type count toward objectives.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;During the action phase, if the active player has the &lt;i&gt;Trade&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card&amp;rsquo;s primary ability. To resolve the primary ability on the &lt;i&gt;Trade&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, the active player resolves the following effects in order:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1&lt;/b&gt;: The active player gains 3 trade goods.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2&lt;/b&gt;: The active player replenishes their commodities by taking the number of commodity tokens necessary to have an amount equal to the commodity value on their faction sheet. Then, they place those tokens in the commodity area of their faction sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A player cannot have more commodities than the commodity value printed on their faction sheet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 3&lt;/b&gt;: The active player chooses any number of other players. Those players use the secondary ability of this card without spending a command token.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;The chosen players &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; resolve the secondary ability of this card without spending a command token after the active player finishes resolving the primary ability.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The chosen players can only use the secondary ability once, and they cannot use it by spending command tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After the active player resolves the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Trade&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool to replenish their commodities.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;A trade good represents a player&amp;rsquo;s buying and trading power beyond their planet&amp;rsquo;s raw resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Trade goods and commodities are represented by opposite sides of the same token.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player gains a trade good, they take a trade good token from the supply and place it on the trade good area on their command sheet, making sure the trade good side is faceup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player can spend trade goods at any time during the game.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player can spend a trade good in one of the following ways:&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;In place of spending one resource.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;In place of spending one influence. However, trade goods cannot be spent to cast votes during the agenda phase.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;To resolve an effect that specifically requires that a trade good be spent.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player can exchange their trade goods with other players during a transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player receives a commodity token from another player, the player who received that token places it in their trade good area with the trade good side of the token faceup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;That token is no longer a commodity token; it is a trade good token.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Trade good tokens come in values of one and three. A player can swap between these tokens as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Say, for example, Alice is the active player, and is performing a strategic action with the &lt;i&gt;Trade&lt;/i&gt; strategy card. To her left is Bob. To his left is Cheng, then Diego, then Esther, then Fahd. The full order of steps is:&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A deal made during a given step is non&amp;ndash;binding if any part of it is to resolve during a later step.

    &lt;li&gt;If a player has their maximum number of commodities, and is instructed to replenish their commodities, they will take no commodities.

        &lt;li&gt;If a player stops being neighbors with another player that they have performed a transaction with this turn, but then becomes neighbors with that player again later that same turn, they cannot perform a second transaction with that player.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player may perform a transaction during combat with their opponent, even if they are neighbors only in the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player may perform multiple action on their turn, they may still only resolve one transaction with each of their neighbors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an agenda is discarded and replaced with another, players who resolved a transaction during the discarded may resolve another transaction during the replacement agenda.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;When a ship moves, it may transport any combination of fighters and ground forces, but the number of units it transports cannot exceed that ship&amp;rsquo;s capacity value.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The ship can pick up and transport fighters and ground forces when it moves. During a tactical action, it can pick up and transport units from the active system, the system it started its movement in, and each system it moves through.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;These transported units remain with the transporting ship until it is finished moving.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Units being transported by a ship that is removed from the board by a gravity rift are also removed from the board.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any fighters and ground forces that a ship transports must move with the ship and remain in the space area of a system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Fighters and ground forces cannot be picked up from a system that contains one of their faction&amp;rsquo;s command tokens other than the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player can land ground forces on a planet in a system during the &lt;b&gt;Invasion&lt;/b&gt; step of a tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_Transport_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ship that can both move and be transported (i.e. Fighter II) cannot do both by &amp;ldquo;meeting&amp;rdquo; a ship with capacity partway though a tactical action movement, as all movement is simultaneous.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ship may transport as it retreats or is otherwise moved out of the active system, as the units it transports will be picked up from the active system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ship may pick up ground forces from a planet in the active system, usually to invade a different planet in the same system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ship cannot pick up more units from a planet than it has capacity. However, a ship may pick up any units (including none) in a system as it transports, even if doing so would cause units to be removed due to capacity limits.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;For example, say a carrier (with capacity 4) is in the space area of a system along with four fighters. On the only planet in that system are eight infantry. There are no other units in the system. When the carrier moves out of the system, it obeys the following:&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The carrier may transport the four fighters, leaving behind all eight of the infantry in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The carrier may transport four of the eight infantry, leaving behind the four remaining infantry in the system. Now that the system has zero capacity, all four of the fighters will be removed.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The carrier may transport two of the eight infantry and two of the four fighters, leaving behind the six remaining infantry in the system. Now that the system has zero capacity, the two remaining fighters will be removed.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The carrier may transport nothing, leaving behind all eight of the infantry in the system. Now that the system has zero capacity, all four of the fighters will be removed.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The carrier cannot attempt to pick up all eight infantry, even if it immediately removes four of them (and the fighters).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A future rule change will allow a player&amp;rsquo;s ships to transport units from systems that contain that player&amp;rsquo;s command token when those ships move outside of a tactical action.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;A unit upgrade is a type of technology card.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Unit upgrades share a name with a unit that is printed on a player&amp;rsquo;s faction sheet, but have a higher roman numeral. For example, a player&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Carrier I&amp;rdquo; unit is upgraded by the unit upgrade technology &amp;ldquo;Carrier II&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Nekro Virus player may upgrade their units with units of the same type (e.g., &amp;ldquo;dreadnought&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;infantry&amp;rdquo;) even if those unit&amp;rsquo;s names do not match. If the Nekro Virus gains a unit upgrade technology of the same unit type as a unit upgrade technology they already have, the previous upgrade is removed, and they must use the same Valefar Assimilator token that was used to copy the previous upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players place unit upgrades they gain faceup on their faction sheets, covering the unit that shares a name with that upgrade card.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The white arrows next to an attribute on a faction sheet indicate that the attribute will improve when the unit is upgraded.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After a player gains a unit upgrade card, each of that player&amp;rsquo;s units that correspond to that upgrade card is treated as having the attributes and abilities printed on that upgrade card. Any previous attributes of that unit, such as the one printed on that player&amp;rsquo;s faction sheet, are ignored.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;The first player to gain 10 victory points wins the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players gain victory points in a variety of ways. A common way that a player can gain victory points is by scoring objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each player uses the victory point track to indicate the number of victory points they have gained.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the players are using the 14&amp;ndash;space side of the victory point track, the game ends and a player wins when they have 14 victory points instead of 10.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Each player places one of their control tokens on space &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; of the victory point track during setup.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When a player gains a victory point, they advance their control token a number of spaces along the victory point track equal to the number of victory points gained.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A player&amp;rsquo;s control token must always be on the space of the victory point track that shows a number that matches the number of victory points that player has gained during the game. A player cannot have more than 10 victory points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If an ability refers to the player with the &amp;ldquo;most&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fewest&amp;rdquo; victory points, and more than one player is tied in that respect, the effect applies to all of the tied players.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player gains a victory point from a law, and that law is discarded, that player does not lose that victory point.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The game ends immediately when one player has 10 victory points. If multiple players would simultaneously gain their 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; victory point, the player who is earliest in initiative order among those players is the winner; if this occurs when players do not have strategy cards, the player who is nearest the speaker (including the speaker) in clockwise order is the winner.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the game ends because the speaker cannot reveal an objective card, the player with the most victory points is the winner. If one or more players are tied for having the most victory points, the tied player who is first in initiative order is the winner.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Warfare&lt;/i&gt; strategy card allows a player to remove a command token from the board and redistribute their command tokens between their tactic, fleet, and strategy pools. This card&amp;rsquo;s initiative value is &amp;ldquo;6&amp;rdquo;. During the action phase, if the active player has the &lt;i&gt;Warfare&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, they can perform a strategic action to resolve that card&amp;rsquo;s primary ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve the primary ability on the &lt;i&gt;Warfare&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, the active player performs the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 1&lt;/b&gt;: The active player removes any one of their command tokens from the game board. Then, that player gains that command token by placing it in a pool of their choice on their command sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step 2&lt;/b&gt;: The active player can redistribute their command tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After the active player resolves the primary ability of the &lt;i&gt;Warfare&lt;/i&gt; strategy card, each other player, beginning with the player to the left of the active player and proceeding clockwise, may spend one command token from their strategy pool to resolve the &lt;sc&gt;Production&lt;/sc&gt; ability of one space dock in their home system.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The command token is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; placed in their home system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

  <data name="RuleCategory_WormholeNexus" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;The wormhole nexus is a system tile where several wormholes converge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol class="lrr"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The wormhole nexus begins the game in play with its inactive side up.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The inactive side of the wormhole nexus contains a gamma wormhole. The active side of the wormhole nexus contains an alpha, beta, and gamma wormhole.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The wormhole nexus is treated as part of the game board.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The wormhole nexus is on the edge of the game board.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;After a player moves or places a unit into the wormhole nexus, or gains control of the planet Mallice, that player flips the wormhole nexus to its active side.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;When a ship moves into the wormhole nexus, the nexus becomes active at the end of the &lt;b&gt;Movement&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

  </data>
  <data name="RuleCategory_WormholeNexus_Notes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;ol class="note"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The wormhole nexus will flip if a unit exists in the system while inactive, even if that unit did not move through a gamma wormhole.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;As the wormhole nexus becomes active at the end of the &lt;b&gt;Movement&lt;/b&gt; step, only units with the &lt;sc&gt;Deep Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; ability in systems containing a gamma wormhole will be able to produce hits during the &lt;b&gt;Space Cannon Offense&lt;/b&gt; step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If the Creuss player moves their &lt;i&gt;Hil Colish&lt;/i&gt; flagship into the inactive wormhole nexus, the wormhole nexus will not flip before they move any other ships. Any other ships they wish to move into the wormhole nexus must do so via either a delta wormhole or a gamma wormhole, unless the Creuss player is utilizing the ability of their agent, Emissary Taivra.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Any units and tokens on the inactive side are transferred to the active side when the wormhole nexus flips.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A ship in the wormhole will single&amp;ndash;handedly qualify for the &lt;i&gt;Become the Gatekeeper&lt;/i&gt; objective.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;There are two basic types of wormholes: alpha and beta.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player has a PDS unit upgrade technology, they can use the &lt;sc&gt;Space Cannon&lt;/sc&gt; abilities of their PDS units through wormholes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Players can be neighbors and perform transactions through wormholes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There are two advanced types of wormhole: delta and gamma. These wormholes follow all other wormhole rules.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The delta wormholes are present on the Creuss Gate system tile and the Ghosts of Creuss home system tile.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;A system with a wormhole is not an anomaly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a system contains multiple wormholes of the same type, those are treated as separate wormholes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A system cannot be adjacent to itself, even if it has multiple wormholes in it.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A player chooses the path of adjacent systems each ship moves through during movement. If two systems on that path are adjacent because of a wormhole, that ship moves through that wormhole.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the two systems are adjacent because of a wormhole and because of a shared edge or another reason, the player may choose whether or not the ship moves through the wormhole.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;If the two systems are adjacent because of two types of wormholes, the player chooses which type of wormhole the ship moves through.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;A player may move a ship back and forth through a wormhole between two systems any number of times, if its movement value is high enough.&lt;/li&gt;
